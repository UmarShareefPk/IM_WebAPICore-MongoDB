She promised us south rooms with a view close\r\ntogether, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a\r\ncourtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by\r\nthe Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at\r\nthe two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the\r\nrow of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between\r\nthe English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late\r\nPoet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at\r\nthe notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),\r\nthat was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you\r\nfeel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all\r\nkinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so\r\ntired.”\r\n\r\n“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying\r\ndown her fork.\r\n\r\n“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her\r\nletter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to\r\ndo it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”\r\n\r\n“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard\r\nthat you shouldn’t have a view.”\r\n\r\nLucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:\r\nof course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first\r\nvacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part\r\nof whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of\r\ngenerosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.\r\n\r\n“No, no. You must have it.”\r\n\r\n“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“She would never forgive _me_.”\r\n\r\nThe ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a\r\nlittle peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness\r\nthey wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one\r\nof them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant\r\nforward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I have a view, I have a view.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them\r\nover for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that\r\nthey would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was\r\nill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy\r\nbuild, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something\r\nchildish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.\r\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her\r\nglance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was\r\nprobably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the\r\nswim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then\r\nsaid: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”\r\n\r\n“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.\r\n\r\n“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll\r\nhave yours. We’ll change.”\r\n\r\nThe better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with\r\nthe new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as\r\npossible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.\r\n\r\n“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again\r\nrepressed her.\r\n\r\n“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And\r\nhe thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,\r\nsaying, “George, persuade them!”\r\n\r\n“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s\r\nnothing else to say.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed\r\nand sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in\r\nfor what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that\r\nwhenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened\r\ntill it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something\r\nquite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the\r\nold man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not\r\nchange? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was\r\npowerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any\r\none so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as\r\nmuch as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who\r\nwere sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs\r\nof the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are\r\ngenteel.”\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with\r\nthe meat that she had once censured.\r\n\r\nLucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will\r\nmake a change.”\r\n\r\nHardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The\r\ncurtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout\r\nbut attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,\r\ncheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired\r\ndecency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.\r\nBeebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,\r\nhowever bad the rooms are. Oh!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett said, with more restraint:\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss\r\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you\r\nhelped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember\r\nthe ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward\r\npleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of\r\nspiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her\r\ncousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer\r\nStreet, too, makes it so specially funny.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss\r\nBartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the\r\ncourse of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you\r\nat Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe\r\nis—’”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer\r\nStreet next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming\r\nneighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not\r\noften we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”\r\n\r\nHe preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than\r\nto Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the\r\ngirl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length\r\nthat she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a\r\nnewcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country\r\nround,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to\r\nFiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are\r\nwrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”\r\n\r\n“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We\r\nare in luck.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People\r\ntold them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,\r\nhow to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,\r\nhow much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had\r\ndecided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way\r\nthey looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose\r\nthe voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.\r\nThat place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in\r\nshaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”\r\n\r\nThe young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then\r\nreturned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.\r\nLucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave\r\nher no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when\r\nshe rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous\r\nlittle bow.\r\n\r\nThe father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,\r\nbut by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nShe hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the\r\ncurtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with\r\nmore than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing\r\ngood-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,\r\nand Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this\r\nattempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.\r\nAnd even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival\r\nthe solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really\r\nItaly?\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which\r\nhad the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.\r\nBeebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and\r\nforwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some\r\ninvisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The\r\nfirst evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a\r\npeculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”\r\n\r\nHe expressed his regret.\r\n\r\n“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us\r\nat dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Emerson.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a friend of yours?”\r\n\r\n“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will say no more.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her very slightly, and she said more.\r\n\r\n“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,\r\nLucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation\r\nto people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.\r\nI hope I acted for the best.”\r\n\r\n“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a\r\nfew moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have\r\ncome of accepting.”\r\n\r\n“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”\r\n\r\n“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said\r\ngently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor\r\nexpect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying\r\nexactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks\r\nyou would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an\r\nobligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at\r\nleast, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”\r\n\r\nLucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so\r\nalways hope that people will be nice.”\r\n\r\n“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every\r\npoint of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will\r\ndiffer. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When\r\nhe first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no\r\ntact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he\r\nwill not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him\r\nto our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching\r\nof the lips.\r\n\r\n“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a\r\nnice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his\r\nfather’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a\r\nSocialist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have\r\naccepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and\r\nsuspicious?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”\r\n\r\n“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent\r\nrudeness?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,\r\nand got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.\r\n\r\n“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why\r\ndidn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I\r\nhaven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as\r\nwell as all dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see\r\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lucia—”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally\r\nlaugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”\r\n\r\n“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will\r\napprove of Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable\r\nworld. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind\r\nthe times.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.\r\n\r\nThere was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval\r\nwas of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy\r\nCorner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not\r\ndetermine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss\r\nBartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am\r\nafraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”\r\n\r\nAnd the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must\r\nbe more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”\r\n\r\nFortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been\r\nsmiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed\r\nto sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to\r\nchatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the\r\ngratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s\r\nhealth, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of\r\nthoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her\r\nsubjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention\r\nthan the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was\r\nproceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real\r\ncatastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when\r\nshe had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,\r\nthough one better than something else.\r\n\r\n“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson\r\nwas more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I think he was meaning to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of\r\ncourse, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could\r\nnot be too careful with a young girl.\r\n\r\nLucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No\r\none was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not\r\nnoticed it.\r\n\r\n“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have\r\nyou ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most\r\nindelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty\r\nand delicacy the same?”\r\n\r\n“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are\r\nso difficult, I sometimes think.”\r\n\r\nShe proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking\r\nextremely pleasant.\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so\r\nglad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing\r\nwhat I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me\r\ncome and ask you. He would be so pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.\r\nThe old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was silent.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I\r\nmust apologize for my interference.”\r\n\r\nGravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett\r\nreply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with\r\nyours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at\r\nFlorence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to\r\nturn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,\r\nMr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and\r\nthen conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”\r\n\r\nShe raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the\r\ndrawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The\r\nclergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with\r\nher message.\r\n\r\n“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\r\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”\r\n\r\nThe young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\r\nfloor, so low were their chairs.\r\n\r\n“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\r\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\r\nhim as soon as he comes out.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came\r\nforth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to\r\nthe delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.\r\n\r\n“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do\r\nto keep polite.”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then\r\nlooking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own\r\nrooms, to write up his philosophic diary.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the\r\nwinds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not\r\nrealize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand\r\nand a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly\r\nrealize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was\r\nreduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,\r\nshe committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.\r\nFor she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the\r\nhalf-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a\r\nsigh, and said:\r\n\r\n“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will\r\nsuperintend the move.”\r\n\r\n“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”\r\n\r\n“But I would like to help you.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her\r\nlife, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So\r\nLucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in\r\nher which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less\r\ndelicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room\r\nwithout any feeling of joy.\r\n\r\n“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken\r\nthe largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;\r\nbut I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure\r\nyour mother would not like it.”\r\n\r\nLucy was bewildered.\r\n\r\n“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under\r\nan obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in\r\nmy small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a\r\nguarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”\r\n\r\n“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of\r\nlarger and unsuspected issues.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as\r\nshe wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and\r\nwhen she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the\r\nclean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to\r\nsee the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,\r\nand the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the\r\ndoor, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards\r\nled, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was\r\nthen that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on\r\nwhich was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the\r\nlight of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,\r\nobnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to\r\ndestroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,\r\nsince it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it\r\ncarefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it\r\nclean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed\r\nheavily according to her habit, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright\r\nbare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are\r\nnot; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini\r\nsport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,\r\nto fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar\r\nfastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees\r\nand marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling\r\nagainst the embankment of the road.\r\n\r\nOver the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy\r\nforeshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for\r\nsome mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the\r\nwindow. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms\r\nwere overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried\r\nto hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their\r\nfaces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,\r\nundersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a\r\ngreat-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them\r\nwalked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went\r\nlittle boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar\r\nbecame entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a\r\ncaterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and\r\nsome white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been\r\nfor the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the\r\nroad might never have got clear.\r\n\r\nOver such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and\r\nthe traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of\r\nGiotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing\r\nbut the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as\r\nwell that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on\r\nLucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window\r\nbefore she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the\r\nbest of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin\r\nhad done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\nA conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,\r\nafter all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the\r\nmorning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy\r\nwould rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,\r\nof course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of\r\ncourse she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy\r\nwould stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!\r\n\r\nAt this point the clever lady broke in.\r\n\r\n“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you\r\ncan neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be\r\nperfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa\r\nBaroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to\r\nschool with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one\r\ntakes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained\r\ntightly behind.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s\r\ndaughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being\r\nso very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a\r\nlong morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you\r\nbring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to\r\nsee where Santa Croce was.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from\r\nBaedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true\r\nItaly—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found\r\nby patient observation.”\r\n\r\nThis sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and\r\nstarted with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.\r\nThe Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right\r\nalong the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the\r\nside streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle\r\nGrazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San\r\nMiniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a\r\nmurderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the\r\nriver were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then\r\nMiss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she\r\nstopped, and she cried:\r\n\r\n“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has\r\nits own smell.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother\r\na distaste to dirt.\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes\r\nfor life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at\r\nthat adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple\r\nsoul!”\r\n\r\nSo Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,\r\nshort, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s\r\ngrace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so\r\ncheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,\r\nonly increased the sense of festivity.\r\n\r\n“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never\r\nrepent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true\r\ndemocracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re\r\nshocked.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.\r\nMy father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful\r\nabout Ireland.”\r\n\r\n“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical\r\nagain now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our\r\nfront door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the\r\nTories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”\r\n\r\n“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over\r\nthe Weald.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.\r\n\r\n“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very\r\nnicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there\r\nwas?”\r\n\r\n“Very well indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you\r\nhave property in Surrey?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty\r\nacres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her\r\naunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last\r\nname of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street\r\nthe other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And\r\njust as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”\r\n\r\nCertainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the\r\ntower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But\r\nMiss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that\r\nLucy had followed her with no misgivings.\r\n\r\n“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have\r\ntaken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!\r\nWhat are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is\r\nwhat _I_ call an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,\r\nthat they should ask the way there.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, _not_\r\nto look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We\r\nwill simply drift.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,\r\nneither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the\r\ncity abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,\r\nand became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy\r\nappeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the\r\nliving terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can\r\never stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from\r\nthe garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against\r\ncirclets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more\r\nbeautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her\r\nforward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThe hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or\r\nrather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste\r\nout of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of\r\nthe paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the\r\ngreat unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,\r\nlarge and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white\r\nfaçade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It\r\nwas Santa Croce. The adventure was over.\r\n\r\n“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to\r\nthem. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into\r\nthe church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”\r\n\r\n“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their\r\nrooms. They were so very kind.”\r\n\r\n“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my\r\nItaly like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to\r\nset an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who\r\ncouldn’t pass it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you ask us?”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest\r\nthat she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood\r\nthey reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it\r\nwhen Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:\r\n\r\n“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak\r\nflapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an\r\nold man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.\r\n\r\nLucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The\r\nbeggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that\r\na young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly\r\ninto the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was\r\nreally almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her\r\nlocal-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both\r\ngesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly\r\nbecause Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her\r\nBaedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way\r\nabout in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never\r\nbe in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,\r\ntalking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was\r\nfull of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and\r\nhumiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the\r\nFranciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful\r\nbuilding. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it\r\ncontained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values\r\nshe was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her\r\nwhich they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be\r\nenthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was\r\nno one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved\r\nthe nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one\r\nthat had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.\r\n\r\nThen the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of\r\nacquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the\r\nItalian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into\r\nthe church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and\r\nout of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,\r\nnot to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their\r\nBaedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that\r\novertook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their\r\ncareer by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to\r\nthe Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it\r\nvery slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with\r\ntheir fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then\r\nretreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy\r\nrealized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to\r\nacquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby\r\nstumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.\r\nRuskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.\r\nProtestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell\r\nheavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.\r\n\r\n“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had\r\ndarted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the\r\nsunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where\r\nyou ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”\r\n\r\nThe child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful\r\npeople who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him\r\nnot to be superstitious.\r\n\r\n“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,\r\ncold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”\r\n\r\nThe child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.\r\nEmerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an\r\nItalian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the\r\nrescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she\r\nstiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his\r\nknees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.\r\n\r\n“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than\r\nall the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe\r\nin those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of\r\nthe universe—”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a phrase.\r\n\r\n“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.\r\n\r\nIn her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was\r\ndetermined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,\r\nif possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious\r\nreference to the pleasant rooms.\r\n\r\n“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what\r\nare you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the\r\nchurch?”\r\n\r\n“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss\r\nLavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too\r\nbad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come\r\nin by myself.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.\r\n\r\n“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the\r\nyoung lady for the first time.\r\n\r\n“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”\r\n\r\n“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s\r\nworth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”\r\n\r\nLucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not\r\nsure whither it would lead her.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this\r\nwhere the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not\r\nsuppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the\r\nchild, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.\r\nI hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating\r\nwhat you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;\r\nbut you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead\r\nwhat part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a\r\nreal pleasure.”\r\n\r\nNow, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been\r\nfurious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is\r\ndifficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.\r\nEmerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the\r\nother hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to\r\nbe offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was\r\nat him that she gazed before replying.\r\n\r\n“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you\r\nwill kindly tell me which they are.”\r\n\r\nThe son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to\r\nthe Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt\r\nlike a child in school who had answered a question rightly.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of\r\nthem rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship\r\nGiotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;\r\nhow it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before\r\nany taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these\r\nfrescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the\r\nsnares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,\r\nmore pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge\r\nand technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”\r\n\r\n“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.\r\n“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means\r\nthe workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no\r\ntruth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I\r\ndo, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”\r\n\r\nHe was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,\r\nthe lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted\r\nuneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with\r\nthese men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and\r\nso strange that she could not remember how to behave.\r\n\r\n“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”\r\n\r\nGeorge replied:\r\n\r\n“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to\r\nheaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should\r\nlike my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”\r\n\r\n“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie\r\nat peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as\r\nsurely as our work survives.”\r\n\r\n“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,\r\nwhoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two\r\nparties. We will incommode you no longer.”\r\n\r\nThe lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,\r\nfor they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They\r\nfiled out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little\r\nold ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine\r\nAlan.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”\r\n\r\nThe procession disappeared without a word.\r\n\r\nSoon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the\r\nlife of St. Francis.\r\n\r\n“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”\r\n\r\nGeorge went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I\r\ndon’t remember.”\r\n\r\n“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.\r\nEager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go\r\nand say we are sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”\r\n\r\n“He will not come back,” said George.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the\r\nRev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear\r\nthe lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old\r\nman, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every\r\nlittle contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.\r\n\r\n“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He\r\nwill try to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.\r\n\r\n“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people\r\nbecause he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or\r\nfrightened.”\r\n\r\n“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I\r\nthink that a kind action done tactfully—”\r\n\r\n“Tact!”\r\n\r\nHe threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong\r\nanswer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.\r\nFor a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon\r\nit—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again\r\nat Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of\r\nacorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,\r\nof tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon\r\npassed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born\r\nof silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,\r\nand she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone\r\nfamiliar to her.\r\n\r\n“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.\r\n\r\n“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They\r\nwon’t come back.”\r\n\r\n“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in\r\nothers...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on\r\nSt. Francis came floating round the partition wall.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at\r\nthose saints?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone\r\nthat is praised in Ruskin?”\r\n\r\nHe did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.\r\nGeorge, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man\r\nwandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a\r\nbarn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were\r\nalso beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old\r\nlady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his\r\nMass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half\r\ninterested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had\r\nimpaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.\r\n\r\n“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about\r\nhis tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the\r\nwhole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”\r\n\r\nLucy again felt that this did not do.\r\n\r\n“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to\r\ngive him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the\r\nsuperstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the\r\nname of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to\r\ngrow up happy.”\r\n\r\nShe was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old\r\nman, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother\r\nmight not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte\r\nwould object most strongly.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday\r\nto Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to\r\nhave been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What\r\ndid you say?”\r\n\r\nLucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:\r\n\r\n“Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love\r\nwith my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are\r\nnearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.\r\nYou might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.\r\nYou stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are\r\ninclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself\r\ngo. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,\r\nand spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By\r\nunderstanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be\r\ngood for both of you.”\r\n\r\nTo this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.\r\n\r\n“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.\r\n\r\n“The old trouble; things won’t fit.”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”\r\n\r\nIn his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting\r\npoetry, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘From far, from eve and morning,\r\n    And yon twelve-winded sky,\r\nThe stuff of life to knit me\r\n    Blew hither: here am I’\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that\r\nwe come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life\r\nis perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But\r\nwhy should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and\r\nwork and rejoice. I don’t believe in this world sorrow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Honeychurch assented.\r\n\r\n“Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of\r\nthe everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a\r\nYes.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy\r\nbecause the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,\r\nor a Yes, or something!\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then\r\nshe became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no\r\nparticular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally\r\nforget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for\r\nmy brother. Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the\r\nLakes.”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.\r\nThis did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him\r\nand that he was thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her\r\nat all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings\r\nwere as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,\r\nbefore she lost Baedeker. The dear George, now striding towards them\r\nover the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He approached,\r\nhis face in the shadow. He said:\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing\r\nthe whole of life in a new perspective. “Where? Where?”\r\n\r\n“In the nave.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson. “Poor girl!”\r\n\r\nShe could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think\r\nmyself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I’m thoroughly happy, and\r\nhaving a splendid time. Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.\r\nThere’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to\r\ninvent it. Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah,\r\nyes! there does come my cousin. A delightful morning! Santa Croce is a\r\nwonderful church.”\r\n\r\nShe joined her cousin.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered\r\na more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer\r\neither deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.\r\nThe kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept\r\nthose whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The\r\ncommonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without\r\neffort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and\r\nthinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate\r\nhis visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.\r\nPerhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy\r\nhad done so never.\r\n\r\nShe was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings\r\nof pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one\r\nof her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who\r\nperforms so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.\r\nPassion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped\r\nbetween love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the\r\npictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was\r\ngreat, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what\r\nand over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.\r\nBut that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can\r\ngainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and\r\nLucy had decided that they should triumph.\r\n\r\nA very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she\r\nreally liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few\r\npeople lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she\r\nmade no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to\r\nsleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of\r\nMiss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for\r\nher cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by\r\nthe mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by\r\ntouch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical\r\nelement in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge\r\nWells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments\r\nwhere the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with\r\na respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish,\r\nunder the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the\r\ndrawing of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was “Miss\r\nHoneychurch. Piano. Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it\r\nwould be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his\r\ncomposure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He was in\r\nsuspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens\r\ndoes one know what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening\r\ntheme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords\r\nthat herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He\r\nwas glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have\r\npaid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of\r\nnine-sixteen. The audience clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr.\r\nBeebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.\r\n\r\n“Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her choice of a\r\npiece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal\r\nthat it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if\r\nanything, disturbs.”\r\n\r\n“Introduce me.”\r\n\r\n“She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises\r\nof your sermon.”\r\n\r\n“My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe. “Why ever did she listen to it?”\r\n\r\nWhen he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,\r\ndisjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity\r\nof dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going\r\nto concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee\r\nand meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But\r\nbefore he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he\r\nnow made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved\r\ndreamily towards him:\r\n\r\n“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very\r\nexciting both for us and for her.”\r\n\r\nLucy at once re-entered daily life.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she\r\nsaid she trusted I should never live a duet.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over\r\nanything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make out.\r\nOnce, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any\r\none’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I\r\nplayed well; I only meant—”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.\r\n\r\n“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not\r\ncomplete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole\r\nlife of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in\r\nEurope had turned into formless lumps of clothes.\r\n\r\nThe street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,\r\nand the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were\r\nconcealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon\r\nto visit the Torre del Gallo.\r\n\r\n“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.\r\n\r\n“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,\r\ntired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and\r\na tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world\r\nwas singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse\r\nto stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no\r\nfit companion for a hearty girl.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true\r\nItaly in the wet I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,\r\nthe supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of\r\ndefinition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but\r\nthey would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for\r\nother reasons, he held his peace.\r\n\r\n“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is\r\nwriting a book?”\r\n\r\n“They do say so.”\r\n\r\n“What is it about?”\r\n\r\n“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.\r\nLet me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words\r\nherself more admirably than any one I know.”\r\n\r\n“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But\r\nI don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in\r\nSanta Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically\r\nalone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.”\r\n\r\n“The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.”\r\n\r\nHe was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently\r\ndissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each\r\nother’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed he\r\nunderstood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of\r\nstrangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting her\r\nfrom the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at\r\nTunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they\r\nwere his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample\r\nopportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,\r\nbut Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his\r\nattitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather\r\nthan enthralled.\r\n\r\nLucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The\r\nArno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts\r\nupon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull\r\nhaze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean\r\nworse. She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the\r\nroom, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at\r\nthe same moment by the door.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here\r\nbesides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually\r\nnursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”\r\n\r\nShe sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was\r\non entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.\r\n\r\n“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in\r\nmy room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one\r\nhas the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches\r\nit from another.”\r\n\r\nLucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of\r\nhis adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his\r\nbath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented\r\nhimself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians\r\nare a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,\r\nand they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their\r\nmercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the\r\ncab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.\r\nYet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no\r\nconception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,\r\nwho exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I\r\nsuffer over the children’s edjucaishion. _Hi_ won’t ’ave my little\r\nVictorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’”\r\n\r\nMiss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an\r\nagreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe,\r\nhaving expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and\r\nwho wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed\r\nthat tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that\r\nmilitant form?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last\r\nthe cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted a\r\ngun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the\r\ninitials “E. L.”\r\n\r\n“That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman. “A good fellow, Lavish,\r\nbut I wish she’d start a pipe.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.\r\n“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as\r\ndreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after\r\nher life’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it\r\nmore excusable.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” asked Lucy.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It\r\nwas a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice\r\nnovel. It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I\r\nmust say they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in\r\nthe Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she\r\nwent for a little ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But\r\nyou know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to\r\nthe beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember\r\nwhat she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got\r\ntempted into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say\r\nthat she is writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the\r\nother day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be\r\nabout modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not\r\nstart till she had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration,\r\nthen she came here—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful\r\nthrough it all! I cannot help thinking that there is something to\r\nadmire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.”\r\n\r\nMiss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better\r\njudgement. A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving\r\nthem unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there\r\nsometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made\r\nalmost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\n“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but\r\nshe behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew\r\nshe would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole,\r\nthe lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr.\r\nEmerson, who puts things very strangely—”\r\n\r\nHer jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were\r\nendless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a\r\nhasty whisper:\r\n\r\n“Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and\r\nhe may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed;\r\nit was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But\r\nthe point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his\r\nmentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different\r\ngrades of thought. She thought they were commercial\r\ntravellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she\r\ntried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on\r\nnothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table\r\nbefore the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one\r\nwho can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful\r\npicture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut! The early\r\nVictorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ My sister had\r\ngone, and I felt bound to speak. I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early\r\nVictorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure\r\nagainst our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how\r\nthe Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must\r\nsay she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson\r\noverheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!\r\nI honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman! I tell things so\r\nbadly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on\r\naccount of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was\r\nnot all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss\r\nAlan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.\r\nCome, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation,\r\nand she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas,\r\nand said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who\r\nwas in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial\r\ntravellers.”\r\n\r\n“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I\r\nshall go alone.’ She went. At the end of five minutes she returned\r\nunobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.\r\n\r\n“No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to\r\ntell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do\r\nnot mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”\r\n\r\nThe little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.\r\nBeebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:\r\n\r\n“I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after\r\nthat business of the violets.”\r\n\r\n“Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get\r\nround? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how\r\nthey behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss\r\nHoneychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do\r\n_not_ like the Emersons. They are _not_ nice.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce\r\nthe Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was\r\nalmost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who\r\nrepresented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,\r\nwho stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett,\r\nsmarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy\r\nwas different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in\r\nSanta Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and\r\npossibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from\r\ntheir own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows\r\nand joys. This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be\r\nchampioned by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all,\r\nhe knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are\r\nflimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.\r\n\r\nLucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the\r\nEmersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their\r\nseats at dinner had been moved.\r\n\r\n“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said\r\nthe little lady inquisitively.\r\n\r\n“Only once. Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite\r\npolitely, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Most right of her. They don’t understand our ways. They must find\r\ntheir level.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their\r\nattempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost\r\nas silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant\r\nday for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy\r\nwell chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief\r\npleasures to provide people with happy memories.\r\n\r\nEvening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the\r\ncolours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its\r\nmuddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of\r\nbluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the\r\nearth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in\r\nthe declining sun.\r\n\r\n“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. “All the\r\ngalleries are shut.”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall go out,” said Lucy. “I want to go round the town in\r\nthe circular tram—on the platform by the driver.”\r\n\r\nHer two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for\r\nher in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:\r\n\r\n“I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out\r\nalone, won’t you be better on your feet?”\r\n\r\n“Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!”\r\n\r\nBut they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe\r\nas to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the\r\nstreet frequented by tourists.\r\n\r\n“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her\r\nfrom the window, “and she knows it. I put it down to too much\r\nBeethoven.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after\r\nmusic. She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the\r\nsuggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she\r\nwanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her\r\non the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not\r\nattempt. It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike?\r\nCharlotte had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were\r\ninferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to\r\ninspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.\r\nIndirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could\r\naccomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be\r\nfirst censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been\r\nwritten to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have\r\ngone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She\r\nreigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early\r\nVictorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of\r\nbusiness, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.\r\nBut alas! the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are\r\nspringing up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and\r\nvast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the\r\nkingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a\r\nradiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the\r\nreceding heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move\r\njoyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with\r\nother men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are\r\nalive. Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august\r\ntitle of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.\r\n\r\nLucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to\r\nwhich she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious. Nor has she\r\nany system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her\r\nparticularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that\r\nshe had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would\r\nreally like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As\r\nshe might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.\r\n\r\nThere she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus,\r\nbeing a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss\r\nBartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course\r\nsignified the nude.) Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the\r\nSistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt a\r\nlittle calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s\r\n“Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni\r\nMadonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical\r\napproval to every well-known name.\r\n\r\nBut though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed\r\nstill unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her\r\nto be conscious of it. “The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of\r\nbeautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not\r\nsurprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that\r\nit always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza\r\nSignoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to\r\nher. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to\r\nstrike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,\r\nhalf ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who\r\nidled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance\r\nof a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth\r\nupon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of\r\nunreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older\r\nperson at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient\r\nwas happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more.\r\n\r\nShe fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out\r\nof the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed no\r\nlonger a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable\r\ntreasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,\r\nstill dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and\r\nstarted towards home.\r\n\r\nThen something did happen.\r\n\r\nTwo Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. “Cinque\r\nlire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and\r\none of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards\r\nLucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for\r\nher. He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out\r\nbetween them and trickled down his unshaven chin.\r\n\r\nThat was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary\r\nman from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson\r\nhappened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where\r\nthe man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught\r\nsight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,\r\nfell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.\r\n\r\nShe thought: “Oh, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nGeorge Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had\r\ncomplained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held\r\nher in his arms.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have\r\ncarried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n“Oh, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“You fainted.”\r\n\r\n“I—I am very sorry.”\r\n\r\n“How are you now?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.\r\n\r\n“Then let us come home. There’s no point in our stopping.”\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The\r\ncries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily. The whole\r\nworld seemed pale and void of its original meaning.\r\n\r\n“How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now\r\nI am well. I can go alone, thank you.”\r\n\r\nHis hand was still extended.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What photographs?”\r\n\r\n“I bought some photographs at Alinari’s. I must have dropped them out\r\nthere in the square.” She looked at him cautiously. “Would you add to\r\nyour kindness by fetching them?”\r\n\r\nHe added to his kindness. As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose\r\nwith the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the\r\nArno.\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch!”\r\n\r\nShe stopped with her hand on her heart.\r\n\r\n“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am, thank you so very much.”\r\n\r\n“No, you aren’t. You’d go openly if you were.”\r\n\r\n“But I had rather—”\r\n\r\n“Then I don’t fetch your photographs.”\r\n\r\n“I had rather be alone.”\r\n\r\nHe said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit\r\ndown till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him. “And\r\ndon’t move till I come back.”\r\n\r\nIn the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in\r\ndreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,\r\nand joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he\r\nreturned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,\r\n“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,\r\nhad crossed some spiritual boundary.\r\n\r\nHe returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy\r\ntopic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous\r\nover the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being\r\nstrong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose\r\nwithout his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,\r\nshe walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to\r\nthem; they refused him.\r\n\r\n“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians\r\nare!—and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that\r\nItalians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my\r\ncousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?”\r\n\r\nHe had thrown something into the stream.\r\n\r\n“What did you throw in?”\r\n\r\n“Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Where are the photographs?”\r\n\r\nHe was silent.\r\n\r\n“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that\r\nof an anxious boy. Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.\r\n“They were covered with blood. There! I’m glad I’ve told you; and all\r\nthe time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with\r\nthem.” He pointed down-stream. “They’ve gone.” The river swirled under\r\nthe bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed\r\nbetter that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean\r\nthat they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man. “For\r\nsomething tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting\r\nmuddled. It isn’t exactly that a man has died.”\r\n\r\nSomething warned Lucy that she must stop him.\r\n\r\n“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson—”\r\n\r\nHe turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some\r\nabstract quest.\r\n\r\n“I want to ask you something before we go in.”\r\n\r\nThey were close to their pension. She stopped and leant her elbows\r\nagainst the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at\r\ntimes a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that\r\nhave suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“I have behaved ridiculously.”\r\n\r\nHe was following his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what\r\ncame over me.”\r\n\r\n“I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude\r\nrepelled him.\r\n\r\n“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right.”\r\n\r\n“And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are\r\ngossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?”\r\n\r\n“Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right—all right.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much. And would you—”\r\n\r\nShe could not carry her request any further. The river was rushing\r\nbelow them, almost black in the advancing night. He had thrown her\r\nphotographs into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her\r\nthat it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do\r\nher no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even\r\nkind; he might even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry;\r\nhis thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was\r\nuseless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete\r\nthe sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the\r\nknight in that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he\r\nremembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that\r\nshe had bought in Alinari’s shop. It was not exactly that a man had\r\ndied; something had happened to the living: they had come to a\r\nsituation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the\r\nbranching paths of Youth.\r\n\r\n“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents\r\ndo happen, and then one returns to the old life!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t.”\r\n\r\nAnxiety moved her to question him.\r\n\r\nHis answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.”\r\n\r\n“But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I shall want to live, I say.”\r\n\r\nLeaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,\r\nwhose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte\r\nBartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over\r\nLucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and\r\npaid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and\r\nMiss Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the\r\nDazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent\r\nand _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It\r\nmight have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match\r\nfor any one.\r\n\r\nFor good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None of\r\nher friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the\r\nembankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at\r\ndinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much\r\nBeethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,\r\nnot that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was\r\naccustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,\r\ncontradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking\r\nright or wrong.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two\r\nplans between which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the\r\nTorre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss\r\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for\r\nherself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But she\r\nthought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing\r\nmoney, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss\r\nBartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of\r\nMr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure\r\nthat called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How\r\nabominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should\r\nalter. All morning she would be really nice to her.\r\n\r\nShe slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the\r\nLung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and\r\ncolour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at\r\nit. She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and\r\nyour mother could see this, too!”\r\n\r\nLucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly\r\nwhere she did.\r\n\r\n“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I\r\nfeared you would repent you of your choice.”\r\n\r\nSerious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been\r\na muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down\r\neasily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping\r\nwere preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del\r\nGallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not\r\nto re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nBut though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately\r\nremained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the\r\nriver to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones,\r\na Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For\r\na moment she understood the nature of ghosts.\r\n\r\nThe exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss\r\nLavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them\r\nbriskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an\r\nidea which she thought would work up into a book.\r\n\r\n“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett. “After your despair\r\nof yesterday! What a fortunate thing!”\r\n\r\n“Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to\r\ntell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy\r\npoked at the ground with her parasol.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps you would rather not?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.”\r\n\r\nThe elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable\r\nthat a girl should feel deeply.\r\n\r\n“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless\r\ncreatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we\r\nwouldn’t pry.”\r\n\r\nShe marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few\r\ncalculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the Piazza\r\nsince eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was\r\nunsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had\r\nquarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should\r\nsubstitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and\r\nat the same time furnish an excellent plot.\r\n\r\n“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.\r\n\r\n“I do hope she’s nice.”\r\n\r\nThat desideratum would not be omitted.\r\n\r\n“And what is the plot?”\r\n\r\nLove, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while\r\nthe fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish\r\nconcluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people. Of\r\ncourse, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local\r\ncolouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall\r\nalso introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair\r\nwarning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are\r\nthinking of the Emersons.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.\r\n\r\n“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.\r\nIt is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going\r\nto paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always\r\nheld most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less\r\ntragic because it happened in humble life.”\r\n\r\nThere was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the\r\ncousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across\r\nthe square.\r\n\r\n“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That\r\nlast remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most\r\npathetic novel.”\r\n\r\nLucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her\r\nperceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that\r\nMiss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.\r\n\r\n“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”\r\ncontinued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be\r\nshocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice\r\nand truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high\r\nopinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a\r\npleasant surprise!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching\r\nyou and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”\r\n\r\n“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”\r\n\r\nHis brow contracted.\r\n\r\n“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark\r\nwas made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with\r\na courteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and\r\nMiss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a\r\ndrive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.\r\nThere is a point on that road where we could get down and have an\r\nhour’s ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most\r\nbeautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view\r\nthat Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.\r\nThat man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks\r\nat it to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that\r\nMr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the\r\nresidential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people\r\nwho never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta\r\nafter lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,\r\nand saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.\r\nLiving in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in\r\nRenaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and\r\nexchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather\r\nperception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their\r\npockets the coupons of Cook.\r\n\r\nTherefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.\r\nBetween the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and\r\nit was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who\r\nseemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the\r\npermanent. Tea at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it\r\nyet. But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!\r\n\r\nA few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life\r\nwere grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and\r\nMiss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no\r\nlonger the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte\r\nsomewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming\r\ndid her thanks become more sincere.\r\n\r\n“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain. “In these days\r\nof toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message\r\nof purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful\r\nas it is, it is the town.”\r\n\r\nThey assented.\r\n\r\n“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of\r\ntragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there\r\nis something portentous in such desecration—portentous and\r\nhumiliating.”\r\n\r\n“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett. “Miss Honeychurch happened to\r\nbe passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.”\r\nShe glanced at Lucy proudly.\r\n\r\n“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. “Do not\r\nblame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her\r\nunchaperoned.”\r\n\r\n“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested\r\nsympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing\r\ndetails would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped\r\nmournfully towards her to catch her reply.\r\n\r\n“Practically.”\r\n\r\n“One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss\r\nBartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.\r\n\r\n“For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that\r\nneither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”\r\n\r\nOf the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable\r\nwas this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble\r\nafter blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.\r\n\r\n“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.\r\n\r\n“And you and your friend—”\r\n\r\n“Were over at the Loggia.”\r\n\r\n“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the\r\ndisgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public\r\nnuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes\r\non worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”\r\n\r\nSurely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal\r\nleague of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before\r\nMiss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long\r\nglossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.\r\n\r\n“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of\r\nFra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The\r\nbook it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.\r\n\r\n“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away\r\nfrom the square.\r\n\r\nBut an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a\r\ngrievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;\r\nthe air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;\r\nwould not she intercede? He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on\r\nbread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,\r\nhe did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all\r\nthoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.\r\n\r\nShopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain’s guidance\r\nthey selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little\r\npicture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little\r\nframes, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out\r\nof oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap\r\nmosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from\r\nreal; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and\r\nPsyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost\r\nless in London.\r\n\r\nThis successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had\r\nbeen a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she\r\nknew not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough,\r\nceased to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great\r\nartist. She doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and\r\nculture as she had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new\r\ntest, and they were found wanting. As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte\r\nshe was exactly the same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it\r\nwas impossible to love her.\r\n\r\n“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of\r\nsome sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the\r\nSocialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.”\r\n\r\nThey were talking about the Emersons.\r\n\r\n“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett,\r\nfingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.\r\n\r\n“Generally,” replied Mr. Eager, “one has only sympathy for their\r\nsuccess. The desire for education and for social advance—in these\r\nthings there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men\r\nwhom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as\r\nthey would make of it.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.\r\n\r\n“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.”\r\n\r\nHe uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so he has a wife.”\r\n\r\n“Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the\r\neffrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with\r\nme. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,\r\nwhen he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that\r\nhe does not get more than a snub.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Lucy, flushing.\r\n\r\n“Exposure!” hissed Mr. Eager.\r\n\r\nHe tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had\r\ninterested his audience more than he had intended. Miss Bartlett was\r\nfull of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she wished never to see\r\nthe Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man? We know that\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\n“I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy—an innocent child at\r\nthe time—I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited\r\nqualities may have made him.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“To speak plainly,” said Mr. Eager, “it is. I will say no more.” For\r\nthe first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the\r\nfirst time in her life.\r\n\r\n“You have said very little.”\r\n\r\n“It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.\r\n\r\nHe gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.\r\nShe turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved\r\nquickly. He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It\r\nwas intolerable that she should disbelieve him.\r\n\r\n“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his\r\nwife!”\r\n\r\n“How?” she retorted.\r\n\r\n“To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa\r\nCroce—did they say anything against me?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is\r\nonly their personal charms that makes you defend them.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing\r\ninto the old chaotic methods. “They’re nothing to me.”\r\n\r\n“How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much\r\ndiscomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n“She will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his wife in the\r\nsight of God.”\r\n\r\nThe addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying to\r\nqualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been\r\nimpressive, but was merely awkward. Then Miss Bartlett hastily\r\npurchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.\r\n\r\n“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm\r\nof the approaching drive.\r\n\r\n“Drive? Oh, is our drive to come off?”\r\n\r\nLucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the\r\ncomplacency of Mr. Eager was restored.\r\n\r\n“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. “It\r\nis just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at\r\nall. Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well\r\ninvite him. We are each paying for ourselves.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was\r\nlaunched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.\r\n\r\n“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.\r\nEager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I\r\nforesee a sad kettle of fish.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.”\r\n\r\n“That will mean another carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She knows it herself. The\r\ntruth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.”\r\n\r\nThey were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by\r\nthe central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,\r\nor at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. The\r\nwell-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic\r\ncity where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.\r\nMurder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being\r\nrude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets? Was\r\nthere more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to\r\nevoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a\r\nfulfillment?\r\n\r\nHappy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not\r\nmatter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with\r\nadmirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost\r\nsight of the goal as she approached it. Now she was crouching in the\r\ncorner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag\r\nwhich hung in chaste concealment round her neck. She had been told that\r\nthis was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be\r\nbroached within the walls of the English bank. As she groped she\r\nmurmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.\r\nEager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave\r\nEleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we\r\nmust be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for\r\nappearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor\r\nwill follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how\r\ndifficult it is!”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\n“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the\r\nstruggle, and buttoning up her dress.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn’t boring you. Speak the word,\r\nand, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.\r\n\r\nThere were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of\r\nathletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her\r\nmother’s letters could be. She had read in it of the crocuses which had\r\nbeen bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new\r\nparlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of\r\nthe semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and\r\nbreaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway. She recalled the free, pleasant\r\nlife of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where\r\nnothing ever happened to her. The road up through the pine-woods, the\r\nclean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her\r\nbright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to\r\nwhich, after much experience, a traveller returns.\r\n\r\n“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news\r\nthat interested her least. “Do you know the Vyses?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza\r\nSignoria.”\r\n\r\n“They’re nice people, the Vyses. So clever—my idea of what’s really\r\nclever. Don’t you long to be in Rome?”\r\n\r\n“I die for it!”\r\n\r\nThe Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass, no\r\nflowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting\r\npatches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance—unless we believe in a\r\npresiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity\r\nsuggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment\r\nof youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and\r\nJudith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,\r\nand though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after\r\nexperience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might\r\na hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.\r\n\r\n“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly. “Here’s an idea. What if we\r\npopped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel? For I do\r\nknow what I want. I’m sick of Florence. No, you said you’d go to the\r\nends of the earth! Do! Do!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:\r\n\r\n“Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the\r\nhills?”\r\n\r\nThey passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing\r\nover the unpractical suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson,\r\nMr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and\r\nMiss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians\r\nDrive Them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth\r\nall irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up\r\nthe stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him at once. Neither the Ages of\r\nFaith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany\r\ndriving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on\r\nthe way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender\r\nand pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still\r\nshading her eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her Mr. Eager\r\nobjected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must\r\nguard against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had\r\nbeen made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was\r\nallowed to mount beside the god.\r\n\r\nPhaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling\r\nhimself to drive with his arm round her waist. She did not mind. Mr.\r\nEager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the\r\nindecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy. The\r\nother two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss\r\nLavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without\r\nconsulting Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though\r\nMiss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the\r\npeople were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came\r\nround they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while\r\nMiss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.\r\n\r\nIt was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus\r\ntransformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,\r\nwas now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about\r\nthem, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a\r\nshoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the\r\nsight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.\r\n\r\nLucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these\r\nexplosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss\r\nLavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep,\r\nthanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She looked\r\non the expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have\r\navoided George Emerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown\r\nthat he wished to continue their intimacy. She had refused, not because\r\nshe disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and\r\nsuspected that he did know. And this frightened her.\r\n\r\nFor the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia,\r\nbut by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.\r\nBut to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and\r\nthrough silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled\r\nemotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something\r\nblameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy\r\nstream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house\r\nwithout the passing of a look or word. This sense of wickedness had\r\nbeen slight at first. She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del\r\nGallo. But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative\r\nthat she should avoid him again. And now celestial irony, working\r\nthrough her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave\r\nFlorence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was\r\nover.\r\n\r\n“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like\r\nmyself?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Eager. “Are you indeed? If you will not think me\r\nrude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed\r\nabout like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to\r\nRome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious\r\nof anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’\r\nor ‘through’ and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up\r\ntowns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American\r\ngirl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the\r\nfather replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller\r\ndog.’ There’s travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to\r\ninterrupt his mordant wit. “The narrowness and superficiality of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it\r\nis of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are\r\nhere for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady\r\nHelen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her\r\nname because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see\r\nit if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of\r\nthat thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back\r\nsix hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene\r\nof The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?”\r\n\r\n“It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish. “Tell me, where do they place the\r\nscene of that wonderful seventh day?”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right\r\nlived Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and\r\nthat the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. “Doubtless you know\r\nher monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’? He is working at\r\nGemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I\r\nhear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with\r\nits loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’\r\nFiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and\r\nI think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.”\r\n\r\nDuring this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each\r\nother disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished\r\nto misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were\r\nprobably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept\r\nwith agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the\r\nSettignano road.\r\n\r\n“Piano! piano!” said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped\r\nhis horses up again.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the\r\nsubject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or\r\nwas he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind.\r\nAs the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr.\r\nEmerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n“Piano! piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.\r\n\r\nAn extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. Phaethon, who for\r\nsome time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.\r\n\r\nA little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was\r\nmost unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to\r\ndisentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl\r\nwas immediately to get down.\r\n\r\n“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.\r\n\r\nPhaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but\r\nat its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping\r\nhad awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated,\r\nand patted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish,\r\nthough unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of\r\nBohemianism.\r\n\r\n“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried. “But I dare say I\r\nshall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the\r\nconventions all my life. This is what _I_ call an adventure.”\r\n\r\n“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He\r\nis treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”\r\n\r\n“Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called\r\nout that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave\r\nthemselves properly.\r\n\r\n“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood\r\nin no awe. “Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off\r\nthe box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers—A king\r\nmight envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than\r\nanything I know.”\r\n\r\nHere the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun\r\nto collect.\r\n\r\nMr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a\r\nresolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the\r\ndriver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,\r\nwith unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony. In\r\nMr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling\r\nfountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,\r\nand more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a\r\nclick.\r\n\r\n“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why\r\nshould he appeal to Lucy?\r\n\r\n“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed\r\nat the other carriage. Why?\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got\r\ndown from the box.\r\n\r\n“Victory at last!” said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the\r\ncarriages started again.\r\n\r\n“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson. “It is defeat. You have parted\r\ntwo people who were happy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but\r\nhe would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took\r\nup the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted\r\nfor support to his son.\r\n\r\n“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has\r\nbargained to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his\r\nsoul.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as\r\ntypically British speaks out of his character.\r\n\r\n“He was not driving us well,” she said. “He jolted us.”\r\n\r\n“That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.\r\nCan you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is\r\njustified. And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl,\r\ntoo. It doesn’t do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of\r\nLorenzo de Medici?”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish bristled.\r\n\r\n“Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to\r\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of\r\nhis diminutive stature?”\r\n\r\n“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the\r\npoet. He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t\r\ngo fighting against the Spring.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.\r\n\r\n“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would\r\nrender a correct meaning.”\r\n\r\n“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val\r\nd’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.\r\n“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you\r\nsuppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in\r\nman? But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as\r\nimproper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”\r\n\r\nNo one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for\r\nthe carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the\r\nhill. A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and\r\nmisty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the\r\nroad, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory\r\nwhich stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated,\r\nwet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the\r\nfancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had\r\nascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an\r\neye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he\r\nhad seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he\r\nafterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work. But where\r\nexactly had he stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to\r\nsolve now. And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything\r\nproblematical, had become equally enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nBut it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in\r\nyour head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.\r\nAnd the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.\r\n\r\nThe party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to\r\nkeep together being only equalled by their desire to go different\r\ndirections. Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett\r\nand Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with\r\nthe drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics\r\nin common, were left to each other.\r\n\r\nThe two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper\r\nthat was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio\r\nBaldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson\r\nwhat his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was\r\nvery sorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be\r\nsuch a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had\r\nturned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man\r\nwas not very much hurt at her asking him.\r\n\r\n“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish. “Oh, but I shall die! Of course it\r\nwas the railway!” She could not control her mirth. “He is the image of\r\na porter—on, on the South-Eastern.”\r\n\r\n“Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion. “Hush!\r\nThey’ll hear—the Emersons—”\r\n\r\n“I can’t stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter—”\r\n\r\n“Eleanor!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy. “The Emersons won’t hear, and\r\nthey wouldn’t mind if they did.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly. “Pouf! Wouf! You\r\nnaughty girl! Go away!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.”\r\n\r\n“Please, I’d rather stop here with you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish. “It’s like a school feast; the boys\r\nhave got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to\r\nconverse on high topics unsuited for your ear.”\r\n\r\nThe girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she\r\nwas only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one\r\nwas Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she\r\nhad not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her\r\nremark and seemed determined to get rid of her.\r\n\r\n“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett. “Oh, I do wish Freddy and\r\nyour mother could be here.”\r\n\r\nUnselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of\r\nenthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy\r\nanything till she was safe at Rome.\r\n\r\n“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish. “Observe my foresight.”\r\n\r\nWith many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that\r\nprotect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.\r\nShe sat on one; who was to sit on the other?\r\n\r\n“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me.\r\nReally I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I\r\nshall stand. Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet\r\nin your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked\r\nparticularly moist. “Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my\r\ndress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;\r\nyou are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared\r\nher throat. “Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold. It’s the tiniest\r\ncough, and I have had it three days. It’s nothing to do with sitting\r\nhere at all.”\r\n\r\nThere was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five\r\nminutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished\r\nby the mackintosh square.\r\n\r\nShe addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the\r\ncarriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony\r\nyoung man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the\r\ncourtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.\r\n\r\n“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.\r\n\r\nHis face lit up. Of course he knew where. Not so far either. His arm\r\nswept three-fourths of the horizon. He should just think he did know\r\nwhere. He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them\r\ntowards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.\r\n\r\nMore seemed necessary. What was the Italian for “clergyman”?\r\n\r\n“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.\r\n\r\nGood? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been\r\ngiven to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?”\r\n\r\nShe was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to\r\nmake it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded\r\nhis hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of\r\na minute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way.\r\nIt would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but\r\nas a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces\r\nas well as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of\r\npeople is a gift from God.\r\n\r\nHe only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked\r\nhim with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world was\r\nbeautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence of\r\nSpring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other\r\nthings, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?”\r\n\r\n“Ma buoni uomini.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded\r\nbriskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They\r\nwere nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing\r\nround them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into\r\ncountless pieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the\r\npliant boughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. Not a\r\nstep, not a twig, was unimportant to her.\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\nThere was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice\r\nof Mr. Eager? He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian’s ignorance is\r\nsometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him\r\nunderstand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was\r\nforming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of\r\nthe wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little\r\nopen terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.\r\n\r\n“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.\r\n“Courage and love.”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,\r\nand violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating\r\nthe hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into\r\npools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But\r\nnever again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the\r\nwell-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nStanding at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.\r\nBut he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.\r\n\r\nGeorge had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he\r\ncontemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant\r\njoy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue\r\nwaves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,\r\n“Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss\r\nBartlett who stood brown against the view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the\r\nafternoon. What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was\r\nslow to discover. Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.\r\nCharlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking\r\nhis son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the\r\nheated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the\r\nreturn home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan\r\nhad been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these\r\ntwo thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social\r\ncontretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and\r\nhad consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a\r\npleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost\r\nMr. Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a\r\nmackintosh square. Phaethon had lost the game.\r\n\r\nThat last fact was undeniable. He climbed on to the box shivering, with\r\nhis collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. “Let us\r\ngo immediately,” he told them. “The signorino will walk.”\r\n\r\n“All the way? He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.\r\n\r\n“Apparently. I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the\r\nface; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had\r\nplayed skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had\r\nused scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things\r\nwere, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the\r\nmessage that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a\r\ndying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could\r\ninterpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly,\r\nand perhaps too late.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of\r\nhis employers. He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents,\r\nbut infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he and his\r\ninsight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of\r\ncourse, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the\r\nbushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what\r\nhave we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It\r\nwas of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed\r\ndownwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her; Mr. Eager sat\r\nopposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They\r\nspoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.\r\n\r\nRain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together\r\nunder an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss\r\nLavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the\r\nnext flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:\r\n\r\n“Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there\r\nis something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we\r\nseriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical\r\ndisplay, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?”\r\n\r\n“No—of course—”\r\n\r\n“Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being\r\nstruck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might\r\nattract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we\r\nare infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage—courage and\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\nUnder the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand. At\r\ntimes our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not\r\nwhat exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it\r\nafterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,\r\ngained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nShe renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Eager!” called Mr. Beebe. “We want your assistance. Will you\r\ninterpret for us?”\r\n\r\n“George!” cried Mr. Emerson. “Ask your driver which way George went.\r\nThe boy may lose his way. He may be killed.”\r\n\r\n“Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver\r\nis no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.”\r\n\r\n“He may be killed!” cried the old man. “He may be killed!”\r\n\r\n“Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. “In\r\nthe presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.”\r\n\r\n“What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.\r\n“Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing. But—” she pointed at the\r\ndriver—“_he_ knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?” She\r\ntook out her purse. “It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class\r\npeople. He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book,\r\nshe said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.\r\n\r\n“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day\r\nas any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.\r\n\r\nThere was an explosion up the road. The storm had struck the overhead\r\nwire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen. If they\r\nhad not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard\r\nit as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,\r\nwhich fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They\r\ndescended from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as\r\njoyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a\r\nmoment they realized vast possibilities of good.\r\n\r\nThe older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion\r\nthey knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,\r\neven if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the\r\naccident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers,\r\nthrough miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the\r\ndryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.\r\n\r\n“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can\r\nunderstand me. You warned me to be careful. And I—I thought I was\r\ndeveloping.”\r\n\r\n“Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.”\r\n\r\n“I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse. Once\r\nby the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?”\r\n\r\nThe thought disturbed her repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm\r\nwas worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she\r\nthought it must be near to everyone.\r\n\r\n“I trust not. One would always pray against that.”\r\n\r\n“He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.\r\nBut this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply\r\nslipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a\r\nlittle to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold, and\r\nthe ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a\r\nbook.”\r\n\r\n“In a book?”\r\n\r\n“Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a\r\ncertain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to\r\nher. All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which\r\nnothing could repress.\r\n\r\n“I want to be truthful,” she whispered. “It is so hard to be absolutely\r\ntruthful.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it\r\nover before bed-time in my room.”\r\n\r\nSo they re-entered the city with hands clasped. It was a shock to the\r\ngirl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. The storm had ceased,\r\nand Mr. Emerson was easier about his son. Mr. Beebe had regained good\r\nhumour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone\r\nshe was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long\r\nevening. She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she\r\nshould describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her\r\nmoments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be\r\ncarefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence\r\nthey would disentangle and interpret them all.\r\n\r\n“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself. I shan’t again be\r\ntroubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know\r\nwhat.”\r\n\r\nMiss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently. Music seemed to\r\nher the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with\r\ncommendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.\r\nWhen it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became\r\nrather hysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all\r\nevents to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss\r\nBartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of\r\ngentle reproach:\r\n\r\n“Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my\r\nroom, and I will give a good brush to your hair.”\r\n\r\nWith some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the\r\ngirl. Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?”\r\n\r\nShe was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that\r\nshe would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions\r\nwas all that she had counted upon.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.”\r\n\r\nThe rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt\r\ndamp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers\r\nclose to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic\r\nshadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt\r\nunaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted\r\nthem to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless\r\nand vague, the very ghosts of joy.\r\n\r\n“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett ignored the remark.\r\n\r\n“How do you propose to silence him?”\r\n\r\n“The driver?”\r\n\r\n“My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.”\r\n\r\nLucy began to pace up and down the room.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” she said at last.\r\n\r\nShe understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely\r\ntruthful.\r\n\r\n“How are you going to stop him talking about it?”\r\n\r\n“I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.”\r\n\r\n“I, too, intend to judge him charitably. But unfortunately I have met\r\nthe type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.\r\n\r\n“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here and\r\nlisten to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you\r\nremember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking\r\none person is an extra reason for liking another?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.\r\n\r\n“Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man,\r\nbut obviously he is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his\r\ndeplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no\r\nfarther on with our question. What do you propose to do?”\r\n\r\nAn idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner\r\nand made it part of her, might have proved victorious.\r\n\r\n“I propose to speak to him,” said she.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.\r\n\r\n“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it. But—as you\r\nsaid—it is my affair. Mine and his.”\r\n\r\n“And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him he\r\nanswers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him. But\r\nnow I am not one little bit.”\r\n\r\n“But we fear him for you, dear. You are so young and inexperienced, you\r\nhave lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can\r\nbe—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her\r\nsex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I\r\nhad not arrived, what would have happened?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.\r\n\r\nSomething in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning\r\nit more vigorously.\r\n\r\n“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t think,” said Lucy again.\r\n\r\n“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?”\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t time to think. You came.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?”\r\n\r\n“I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She\r\nwent up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.\r\nShe could not think what she would have done.\r\n\r\n“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett. “You will be\r\nseen from the road.”\r\n\r\nLucy obeyed. She was in her cousin’s power. She could not modulate out\r\nthe key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them\r\nreferred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and\r\nsettle the matter, whatever it was, with him.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett became plaintive.\r\n\r\n“Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is\r\nhopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him. Oh, for your\r\nbrother! He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse\r\nin him a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are\r\nstill left some men who can reverence woman.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and\r\nranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she blew into her gloves and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.”\r\n\r\n“What train?”\r\n\r\n“The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.\r\n\r\nThe girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.\r\n\r\n“When does the train to Rome go?”\r\n\r\n“At eight.”\r\n\r\n“Signora Bertolini would be upset.”\r\n\r\n“We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had\r\ngiven notice already.\r\n\r\n“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.”\r\n\r\n“I expect she will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the\r\nVyses’ hotel. Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained\r\nmotionless and silent. To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled\r\nlike a ghostly figure in a dream.\r\n\r\nThey began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to\r\nlose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,\r\nbegan to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the\r\ndiscomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,\r\nwho was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,\r\nvainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and\r\nsize. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her\r\nback, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.\r\nThe girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of\r\nthose emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.\r\nShe only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier,\r\nthe world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.\r\nThe impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt\r\ndown by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she\r\nwas not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not\r\nlove her, but needed her to love. For it was in ominous tones that she\r\nsaid, after a long pause:\r\n\r\n“Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?”\r\n\r\nLucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what\r\nforgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her\r\nembrace a little, and she said:\r\n\r\n“Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!”\r\n\r\n“You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,\r\ntoo. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.”\r\n\r\n“But no—”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged\r\nmartyr.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had\r\nhoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger and\r\nstronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and\r\nold-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.”\r\n\r\n“Please—”\r\n\r\n“My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and\r\nwere often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a\r\nlady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than\r\nwas necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.\r\n\r\nShe still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,\r\nheart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.\r\n\r\n“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the\r\nstraps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make\r\nyou happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous\r\nto me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.”\r\n\r\n“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it\r\nisn’t a disaster either.”\r\n\r\n“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and\r\nrightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss\r\nLavish?”\r\n\r\n“Every right.”\r\n\r\n“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true\r\nthat I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I\r\ndo, when you tell her.”\r\n\r\nLucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:\r\n\r\n“Why need mother hear of it?”\r\n\r\n“But you tell her everything?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I do generally.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.\r\nUnless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.”\r\n\r\nThe girl would not be degraded to this.\r\n\r\n“Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in\r\nany way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never\r\nspeak of it either to her or to any one.”\r\n\r\nHer promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close. Miss\r\nBartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and\r\nsent her to her own room.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the original trouble was in the background. George would\r\nseem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view\r\nwhich one would take eventually. At present she neither acquitted nor\r\ncondemned him; she did not pass judgement. At the moment when she was\r\nabout to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since,\r\nit was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now,\r\ncould be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss\r\nBartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor\r\ninconsistent. She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,\r\nfor years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented\r\nto the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in\r\nwhich the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a\r\nshamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but\r\nwhich do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have\r\nused them most.\r\n\r\nLucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has\r\nyet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity,\r\nof her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily\r\nforgotten. Never again did she expose herself without due consideration\r\nand precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously\r\nupon the soul.\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters. Before she reached\r\nthem she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,\r\nthough she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked\r\nup, did not see her.\r\n\r\nTo reach his room he had to go by hers. She was still dressed. It\r\nstruck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she\r\nwould be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary\r\nintercourse was over.\r\n\r\nWhether she would have dared to do this was never proved. At the\r\ncritical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:\r\n\r\n“I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.”\r\n\r\nSoon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr.\r\nEmerson.”\r\n\r\nHis heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done\r\nher work.\r\n\r\nLucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true. It can’t all be true. I want not to\r\nbe muddled. I want to grow older quickly.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett tapped on the wall.\r\n\r\n“Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.”\r\n\r\nIn the morning they left for Rome.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for\r\nthe carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They\r\nwere heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that\r\nfiltered through them was subdued and varied. A poet—none was\r\npresent—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,”\r\nor might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against\r\nthe intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;\r\nwithin, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTwo pleasant people sat in the room. One—a boy of nineteen—was studying\r\na small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay\r\nupon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed\r\nand groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human\r\nframe fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did\r\ncontinually read out to him what she had written. And continually did\r\nshe rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light\r\nfell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.\r\n\r\n“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother. “I\r\ntell you I’m getting fairly sick.”\r\n\r\n“For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\nFreddy did not move or reply.\r\n\r\n“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her\r\nson’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n“Time they did.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.”\r\n\r\n“It’s his third go, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might\r\nhave got this off her chest in Italy. I don’t know how girls manage\r\nthings, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t\r\nhave to say it again now. Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do\r\nfeel so uncomfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!”\r\n\r\n“I feel—never mind.”\r\n\r\nHe returned to his work.\r\n\r\n“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: ‘Dear Mrs.\r\nVyse.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.”\r\n\r\n“I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it,\r\nand I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But—’” She stopped\r\nreading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He\r\nhas always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so\r\nforth. When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.”\r\n\r\n“Nor me.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\nFreddy nodded.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“He asked me for my permission also.”\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed: “How very odd of him!”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be\r\nasked?”\r\n\r\n“What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\n“I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’”\r\n\r\n“What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its\r\nwording, had been to the same effect.\r\n\r\n“The bother is this,” began Freddy.\r\n\r\nThen he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.\r\nMrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.\r\n\r\n“Freddy, you must come. There they still are!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.”\r\n\r\n“Peeping like that! Can’t I look out of my own window?”\r\n\r\nBut she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her\r\nson, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For\r\na brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the\r\ngentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.\r\n\r\n“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.”\r\nHe gave a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did\r\ngive—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with\r\nthat, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He\r\npractically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and\r\nfor Windy Corner generally if he married her? And he would have an\r\nanswer—he said it would strengthen his hand.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”\r\n\r\n“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a\r\nstew! I can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to\r\nhave asked me.”\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and\r\ntruthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that\r\na man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I\r\nhope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes. I\r\ntried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed\r\ntoo, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot’s in it.\r\nOh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the\r\nsubject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between\r\nthem in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately\r\ninsult him, and try to turn him out of my house.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him. I don’t\r\nhate him, but I don’t like him. What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the curtains dismally.\r\n\r\n“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “I know his mother; he’s\r\ngood, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick\r\nthe piano! He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well\r\nconnected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face\r\nremained dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”\r\n\r\n“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s\r\nfirst week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not\r\nknowing.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t\r\nsee how Mr. Beebe comes in.”\r\n\r\n“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he\r\nmeans. He said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I\r\nasked him what he meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I\r\ncouldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has\r\ncome after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”\r\n\r\n“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he\r\nmay stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.”\r\n\r\nThe explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at\r\nthe back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one\r\ntoo much for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s\r\nown way. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow\r\nwho would never wear another fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own\r\nprofundity, Freddy checked himself. He must be jealous, or he would not\r\ndislike a man for such foolish reasons.\r\n\r\n“Will this do?” called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just\r\nasked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes\r\nit.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write\r\nthe letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very\r\nuncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’\r\nI said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.\r\nShe goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a\r\nthick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks\r\nwhere you turn on the electric light. She keeps that flat abominably—”\r\n\r\n“Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the\r\ncountry?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes—‘Young people must\r\ndecide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she\r\ntells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her\r\nfirst.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing. I’ll\r\nstop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out,\r\ntoo?”\r\n\r\n“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch left it in.\r\n\r\n“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my\r\npermission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I\r\nhave told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days\r\nyoung people must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your\r\nson, because she tells me everything. But I do not know—’”\r\n\r\n“Look out!” cried Freddy.\r\n\r\nThe curtains parted.\r\n\r\nCecil’s first movement was one of irritation. He couldn’t bear the\r\nHoneychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.\r\nInstinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging\r\ndown their poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as\r\nis owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little\r\nrustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view\r\nbeyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the\r\nSussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a\r\ngreen magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.\r\n\r\nCecil entered.\r\n\r\nAppearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He\r\nwas medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders\r\nthat seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was\r\ntilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled\r\nthose fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.\r\nWell educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained\r\nin the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as\r\nself-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,\r\nworshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a\r\nGreek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe\r\nmeant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same\r\nwhen he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards\r\nher young acquaintance.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”\r\n\r\n“I promessi sposi,” said he.\r\n\r\nThey stared at him anxiously.\r\n\r\n“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English\r\nmade him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.\r\n\r\n“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand\r\nthat was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew\r\nItalian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected\r\nwith little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. We are\r\nobliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\n“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand\r\nat the furniture. “This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you\r\nwill make our dear Lucy happy.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was\r\naffected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most. Why\r\ncould she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;\r\nlooking very cross and almost handsome?\r\n\r\n“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.\r\n\r\nLucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at\r\nthem, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw\r\nher brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He\r\nsaid, “Steady on!”\r\n\r\n“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.\r\n\r\nLucy kissed her also.\r\n\r\n“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all\r\nabout it?” Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”\r\n\r\n“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you go with Lucy.”\r\n\r\nThey passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,\r\nand descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their\r\nways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,\r\nuntil they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of\r\nthe potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.\r\n\r\nSmiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that\r\nhad led to such a happy conclusion.\r\n\r\nHe had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who\r\nhappened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that\r\nafternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of\r\nthe blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had\r\nseemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But\r\nItaly worked some marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held\r\nmore precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful\r\nreticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love\r\nnot so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.\r\nThe things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could\r\nhave anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully\r\nday by day.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if\r\nnot to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he\r\nhad hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other. It had\r\ntouched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion. Her\r\nrefusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase\r\nwent—she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months\r\nlater, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked\r\nher again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo\r\nmore than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;\r\nat his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with\r\nimmeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,\r\nfeeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really\r\nmattered were unshaken.\r\n\r\nSo now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she\r\nhad accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply\r\nsaying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His\r\nmother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must\r\nwrite her a long account.\r\n\r\nGlancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on\r\nit, he moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”\r\nfollowed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and\r\nafter a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on\r\nhis knee.\r\n\r\nThen he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as\r\nthe first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner\r\ndrawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a\r\nsuccessful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he\r\ncould almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.\r\nMaple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished\r\nbook-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s\r\nletter. He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay\r\nin that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his\r\nown fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted\r\nher support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that\r\nothers, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked\r\ntheir permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in\r\nessentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected. “I\r\nrepresent all that he despises. Why should he want me for a\r\nbrother-in-law?”\r\n\r\nThe Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that\r\nLucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very\r\ndefinitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was\r\nshown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s\r\npraise of him in her letters from Florence.\r\n\r\nCecil greeted him rather critically.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”\r\n\r\n“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that\r\nchair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”\r\n\r\n“Pfui!”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch\r\nallows it.”\r\n\r\nFor Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he\r\ndid not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the\r\nlife that he desired.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”\r\n\r\n“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.\r\n\r\n“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I\r\nam first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”\r\n\r\n“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a\r\ngrotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a\r\ngentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But\r\nhis stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert\r\nmight be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.\r\n\r\n“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not\r\nto have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been\r\nrun up opposite the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man\r\nlanguidly. “I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish\r\nCouncil and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference,\r\nor perhaps those aren’t the right names. I only go into the country to\r\nsee my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy\r\nand London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on\r\nsufferance.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,\r\ndetermined to shift the subject.\r\n\r\n“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?”\r\n\r\n“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my\r\ndecadence. My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I\r\nam no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought\r\nto be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t\r\ncare a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”\r\n\r\n“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful\r\nopportunity, the possession of leisure.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to\r\nanswering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must\r\nfeel, that others should have it also.\r\n\r\n“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for\r\nexample, Freddy Honeychurch.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.”\r\n\r\nCecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so\r\nhopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively\r\nafter Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular\r\nregard. Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his\r\nliberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting\r\ntea before evening service.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so\r\ncoached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is that\r\nshe begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the\r\nchair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of\r\nMary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?”\r\n\r\n“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the\r\nstairs.”\r\n\r\n“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the\r\nsuet sufficiently small.”\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and things began to go better.\r\n\r\n“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.\r\n\r\n“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of\r\nFreddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”\r\n\r\n“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.\r\n\r\n“I quite agree. At present she has none.”\r\n\r\n“At present?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss\r\nHoneychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so\r\nwonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be\r\nwonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,\r\nand music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good,\r\nheroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.”\r\n\r\nCecil found his companion interesting.\r\n\r\n“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was\r\nnot wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has\r\nbeen away. You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I\r\nforgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in\r\nFlorence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\nConversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and\r\ndown the terrace.\r\n\r\n“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was\r\nsimply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can\r\nshow you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a\r\nkite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string\r\nbreaks.”\r\n\r\nThe sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he\r\nviewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs\r\nto the string himself.\r\n\r\n“But the string never broke?”\r\n\r\n“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly\r\nhave heard Miss Bartlett fall.”\r\n\r\n“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.\r\n\r\nImmediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,\r\ncontemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He\r\ncursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and\r\nthat Lucy was soaring up to reach him?\r\n\r\n“Broken? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he\r\ncould not keep out of his voice.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with\r\nher, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.\r\nMr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw\r\nLucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.\r\n\r\nCecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down\r\nhis mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get\r\nfrom the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every\r\nthoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was\r\nsensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he could be quite crude.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that\r\nLucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.”\r\n\r\n“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch\r\nonly a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so\r\nfreely with any one; certainly not with you.”\r\n\r\n“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of\r\nplacing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the\r\nprerogatives of his profession.\r\n\r\n“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her\r\nquiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized\r\ndimly enough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it.\r\nShe has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she\r\nhas learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will\r\ntell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to\r\nwave his hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. “She\r\nhas learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was\r\nnow also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable\r\nto her.”\r\n\r\n“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping\r\ngarden. “Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”\r\n\r\nFreddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom\r\ncriticizes the accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could\r\nnot act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology. “Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but\r\ngenerally I’m too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them,\r\ngrave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be\r\nsupremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and\r\nmother. And now I want my tea.”\r\n\r\n“You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted. “How dare you\r\nbe serious at Windy Corner?”\r\n\r\nHe took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more\r\nattempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None\r\nof them dared or was able to be serious any more.\r\n\r\nAn engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all\r\nwho speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the\r\nsolitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be\r\ncritical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they\r\nwere sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not\r\nonly the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one\r\ngreat thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien\r\ncreed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel\r\nsentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become\r\ntrue believers, in case any true believer should be present.\r\n\r\nSo it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon\r\nthey pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant\r\ntea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their\r\nhypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,\r\nputting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated\r\nthem greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she\r\ngave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped.\r\nFreddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family\r\nhonoured pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised\r\nwell as a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had\r\nbeen built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as\r\nearnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made\r\nLucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood,\r\nfor naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying\r\na presentable man.\r\n\r\nCecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was\r\nvery pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his\r\nlong, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him. People congratulated\r\nMrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased\r\nher, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy\r\ndowagers.\r\n\r\nAt tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s\r\nfigured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned\r\nnothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated\r\nby a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left\r\nwith the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were\r\ndriving home.\r\n\r\n“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.\r\n\r\n“Is it typical of country society?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so. Mother, would it be?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember\r\nthe hang of one of the dresses.\r\n\r\nSeeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.”\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry that you were stranded.”\r\n\r\n“Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an\r\nengagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where\r\nevery outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. All those old women\r\nsmirking!”\r\n\r\n“One has to go through it, I suppose. They won’t notice us so much next\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An\r\nengagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and\r\nshould be treated as such.”\r\n\r\nYet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially\r\ncorrect. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,\r\nrejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the\r\ncontinuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something\r\nquite different—personal love. Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s\r\nbelief that his irritation was just.\r\n\r\n“How tiresome!” she said. “Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is\r\ndeprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is\r\nthat of the Inglese Italianato.”\r\n\r\n“Inglese Italianato?”\r\n\r\n“E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?”\r\n\r\nShe did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a\r\nquiet winter in Rome with his mother. But Cecil, since his engagement,\r\nhad taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from\r\npossessing.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There\r\nare certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must\r\naccept them.”\r\n\r\n“We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her\r\nremark that she did not quite understand his position.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,\r\nor whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?”\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.\r\n\r\n“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. “I don’t see any\r\ndifference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption\r\njarred.\r\n\r\n“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her\r\ncard-case on her lap. “This is me. That’s Windy Corner. The rest of the\r\npattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence\r\ncomes here.”\r\n\r\n“We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.”\r\n\r\nShe leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.\r\n\r\n“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and\r\nthat’s Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.”\r\n\r\nLucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect\r\nwhat they meant. She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling\r\nthat prompted it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I never said so!” he cried. “I consider him far above the average. I\r\nonly denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something\r\nsympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful\r\nones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He was truly\r\ninsincere—not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so\r\nconceited, and he did say such unkind things.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of things?”\r\n\r\n“There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his\r\nwife.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he had.”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Why ‘no’?”\r\n\r\n“He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\nCecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.\r\n\r\n“Well, I did try to sift the thing. Mr. Eager would never come to the\r\npoint. He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered\r\nhis wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.\r\n\r\n“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate\r\nshould go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to\r\nhim that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but\r\nhe certainly wasn’t that.”\r\n\r\n“Poor old man! What was his name?”\r\n\r\n“Harris,” said Lucy glibly.\r\n\r\n“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nCecil nodded intelligently.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I hate him. I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto. I hate\r\nhim. Nothing can hide a petty nature. I _hate_ him.”\r\n\r\n“My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “You’ll blow\r\nmy head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to\r\nhate any more clergymen.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s\r\nmoral outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo\r\non the ceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here\r\nlay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not\r\nin muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the\r\nbeautiful creature, but shows that she is alive. After a moment, he\r\ncontemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain\r\napproval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth.\r\n\r\nNature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them. He praised the\r\npine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted\r\nthe hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. The\r\noutdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went\r\nwrong in a question of fact. Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he\r\nspoke of the perpetual green of the larch.\r\n\r\n“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I\r\nfeel I could never live out of it. When I’m in the country I feel the\r\nsame about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees\r\nand the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people\r\nwho live amongst them must be the best. It’s true that in nine cases\r\nout of ten they don’t seem to notice anything. The country gentleman\r\nand the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of\r\ncompanions. Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of\r\nNature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She had not been attending. Cecil,\r\nwho was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt\r\nirritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.\r\n\r\nLucy had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still\r\nlooked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral\r\ngymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an\r\nAugust wood.\r\n\r\n“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and\r\ntouched her knee with his own.\r\n\r\nShe flushed again and said: “What height?”\r\n\r\n“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,\r\nWhat pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).\r\nIn height and in the splendour of the hills?’\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.\r\nWhat’s this place?”\r\n\r\n“Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.\r\n\r\nThe woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.\r\nPretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was\r\noccupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled\r\nspire. Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church. In height it scarcely\r\nexceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were\r\nhidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the\r\nshrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly\r\nlittle villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement,\r\nhaving been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy\r\nhad been acquired by Cecil.\r\n\r\n“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.\r\nThese titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden\r\ngates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed\r\nthe semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. “Albert”\r\nwas inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and\r\nlobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed\r\nin Nottingham lace. “Cissie” was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging\r\nto Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising\r\nfact. Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn\r\nwas yellow with dandelions.\r\n\r\n“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically. “Summer Street\r\nwill never be the same again.”\r\n\r\nAs the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came\r\nout of her.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.\r\n“Here’s Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down\r\nat once!”\r\n\r\nSir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said\r\n“Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss\r\nFlack.”\r\n\r\n“Am I not always right? She ought to have gone before the contract was\r\nsigned. Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s\r\ntime?”\r\n\r\n“But what can I do?” He lowered his voice. “An old lady, so very\r\nvulgar, and almost bedridden.”\r\n\r\n“Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.\r\n\r\nSir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully. He had had full\r\nwarning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot\r\nbefore building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had\r\nknown Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it\r\nbeing spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and\r\nthe apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.\r\nHe called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and\r\nrespectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic\r\nroof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,\r\nhowever, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches\r\nto the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked\r\nto relieve the façade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a\r\ncolumn, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.\r\n\r\nMr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and\r\nall the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another\r\napproaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s\r\ninitials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin. He built his\r\nvillas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an\r\nimmovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.\r\n\r\nThis futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness\r\nas he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage. He had failed in his duties\r\nto the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.\r\nHe had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.\r\nAll he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone\r\nreally desirable.\r\n\r\n“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy\r\nlandlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the\r\npeasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.”\r\n\r\nCecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or\r\ndespise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the\r\nmore fruitful.\r\n\r\n“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously. “It would be\r\na perfect paradise for a bank clerk.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly. “That is exactly what I fear, Mr.\r\nVyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has\r\nimproved—a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from\r\na station in these days of bicycles?”\r\n\r\n“Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.\r\n\r\nCecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied\r\nthat the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most\r\nappalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless\r\nneighbour, and roused herself to stop him.\r\n\r\n“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like\r\nspinsters?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I met them abroad.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them\r\nlast week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I’m really not joking.\r\nThey are quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell\r\nthem to write to you?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed you may!” he cried. “Here we are with the difficulty solved\r\nalready. How delightful it is! Extra facilities—please tell them they\r\nshall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees. Oh, the\r\nagents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when I\r\nwrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social\r\nposition to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As if\r\none cares about that! And several references I took up were most\r\nunsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the\r\ndeceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The\r\ndeceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with\r\nLucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me\r\nfrom people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them\r\nthat make the house smell stuffy. It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather\r\nlet to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has\r\ncome down.”\r\n\r\n“I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very\r\nsad thing.”\r\n\r\n“The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are,” said Cecil. “I haven’t met them but I should say they\r\nwere a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”\r\n\r\n“It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied. “I oughtn’t to come with my\r\ntroubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway\r\nwill only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no\r\nreal help.”\r\n\r\n“Then may I write to my Misses Alan?”\r\n\r\n“Please!”\r\n\r\nBut his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of\r\ncanaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then\r\nthe mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.”\r\n\r\n“Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there’s an end of\r\nthem—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they’re vulgar,\r\nthey somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn’t spread so. Give me a\r\nman—of course, provided he’s clean.”\r\n\r\nSir Harry blushed. Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments\r\nto their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much\r\ndistinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time,\r\nshould descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself. She\r\nwas delighted. Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a\r\nhouse. Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they\r\nwere on a small scale.\r\n\r\nCecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly!” was her cordial reply.\r\n\r\nSir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He beamed\r\nat them knowingly, said, “Aha! young people, young people!” and then\r\nhastened to unlock the house.\r\n\r\n“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of\r\nearshot.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.”\r\n\r\n“He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.”\r\n\r\n“No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life. In London he\r\nwould keep his place. He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife\r\nwould give brainless dinner parties. But down here he acts the little\r\ngod with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and\r\nevery one—even your mother—is taken in.”\r\n\r\n“All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt\r\ndiscouraged. “I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.”\r\n\r\n“It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.\r\nOh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar\r\ntenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.\r\n_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let’s\r\nforget him.”\r\n\r\nThis Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and\r\nMr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered\r\nto her would escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,\r\nnor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any\r\nminute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”? And what would she\r\nreply? Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety\r\nenough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some\r\ntime, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,\r\nduring the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.\r\n\r\n“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.\r\n\r\nNature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them. Summer Street\r\nlay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged\r\nfrom the highroad.\r\n\r\n“Are there two ways?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued\r\nirritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. “Why is it,\r\nLucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never\r\nonce been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but\r\npretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave\r\nher in doubt as to his meaning.\r\n\r\nShe led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did\r\nexplain before they had gone a dozen yards.\r\n\r\n“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with\r\nme in a room.”\r\n\r\n“A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real\r\ncountry like this.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the\r\nsort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that you aren’t. I connect you with a view—a certain type\r\nof view. Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?”\r\n\r\nShe reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Do you know that you’re right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.\r\nWhen I think of you it’s always as in a room. How funny!”\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, he seemed annoyed.\r\n\r\n“A drawing-room, pray? With no view?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the\r\nopen air.”\r\n\r\nShe said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?”\r\n\r\nAs no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too\r\ndifficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every\r\nnow and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of\r\nthe trees. She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy\r\nCorner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy\r\nin it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to\r\nItaly, it had lost none of its charm.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny\r\ngreen alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!”\r\n\r\n“Why do you call it that?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It’s only a\r\npuddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal\r\nof water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and\r\nthe pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe\r\nthere. He is very fond of it.”\r\n\r\n“And you?”\r\n\r\nHe meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed\r\nhere, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.”\r\n\r\nAt another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of\r\nprudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh\r\nair, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as\r\nshe stood by the pool’s edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,\r\nand she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its\r\nown, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.\r\n\r\n“Who found you out?”\r\n\r\n“Charlotte,” she murmured. “She was stopping with us.\r\nCharlotte—Charlotte.”\r\n\r\n“Poor girl!”\r\n\r\nShe smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had\r\nshrunk, now appeared practical.\r\n\r\n“Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.\r\n\r\n“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.”\r\n\r\nAt the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What, Cecil?”\r\n\r\n“Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry\r\nme—”\r\n\r\nHe became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were\r\nobserved. His courage had gone.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Up to now I have never kissed you.”\r\n\r\nShe was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.\r\n\r\n“No—more you have,” she stammered.\r\n\r\n“Then I ask you—may I now?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can’t run at you, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nAt that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her\r\nreply was inadequate. She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.\r\nAs he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil. As he\r\ntouched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the embrace. He considered, with truth, that it had been a\r\nfailure. Passion should believe itself irresistible. It should forget\r\ncivility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined\r\nnature. Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right\r\nof way. Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young\r\nman behind the counter would have done? He recast the scene. Lucy was\r\nstanding flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his\r\narms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his\r\nmanliness. For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.\r\n\r\nThey left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. He waited for\r\nher to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. At\r\nlast she spoke, and with fitting gravity.\r\n\r\n“Emerson was the name, not Harris.”\r\n\r\n“What name?”\r\n\r\n“The old man’s.”\r\n\r\n“What old man?”\r\n\r\n“That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to.”\r\n\r\nHe could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had\r\never had.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no\r\nvery splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents\r\nentitled her to. Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built\r\nWindy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,\r\nand, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there\r\nhimself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.\r\nOther houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and\r\nothers, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk\r\nbarrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy\r\nCorner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but\r\nfrom London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an\r\nindigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife\r\naccepted the situation without either pride or humility. “I cannot\r\nthink what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely\r\nfortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were\r\nreturned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was\r\nnot exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to\r\nmatter. When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few\r\nhonest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best\r\nsociety obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull,\r\nand Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.\r\nHitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly\r\naffluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,\r\norange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to\r\nspeak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive\r\nit, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and\r\nidentical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside\r\nit were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the\r\nLondon fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in\r\nthe northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm\r\nhimself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.\r\nHer senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not\r\nget to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not\r\nparticularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s\r\nolive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you. She returned\r\nwith new eyes.\r\n\r\nSo did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to\r\nirritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of\r\nsaying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to\r\nsubstitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that\r\nLucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities\r\nthat create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its\r\ndefects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize a\r\nmore important point—that if she was too great for this society, she\r\nwas too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal\r\nintercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the\r\nkind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but\r\nequality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most\r\npriceless of all possessions—her own soul.\r\n\r\nPlaying bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged\r\nthirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in\r\nstriking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net\r\nand immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.\r\nThe sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of\r\nmind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing\r\nwhat they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.”\r\n\r\n“But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe. “I wrote to Miss\r\nTeresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called,\r\nand my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They\r\nare coming. I heard from them this morning.\r\n\r\n“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried. “Just because\r\nthey’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their\r\n‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing. And poor Lucy—serve her\r\nright—worn to a shadow.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the\r\ntennis-court. Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a\r\ntennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was\r\nencircled by a ring. “If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move\r\nin before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about\r\nwhitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the\r\nfair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count. I told you not Saturn.”\r\n\r\n“Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.\r\n“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.”\r\n\r\n“Saturn doesn’t bounce.”\r\n\r\n“Saturn bounces enough.”\r\n\r\n“No, he doesn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.\r\n\r\n“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the\r\nBeautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. That’s right,\r\nMinnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over\r\nthe shins!”\r\n\r\nLucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria\r\nCorombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.\r\n\r\nFreddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to\r\nfury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a\r\nwell-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil\r\nheard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not\r\ncome down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and\r\nbore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical\r\nviolence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.\r\n\r\n“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as\r\nLucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her\r\nfeet by her brother.\r\n\r\n“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.\r\n\r\n“They have taken Cissie Villa.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t the name—”\r\n\r\nHere his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the\r\ngrass. An interval elapses.\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.\r\n\r\n“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense yourself! I’ve this minute seen him. He said to me: ‘Ahem!\r\nHoneychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem! ahem! I have at\r\nlast procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’\r\nand slapped him on the back.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. The Miss Alans?”\r\n\r\n“Rather not. More like Anderson.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch exclaimed. “Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right? I _said_\r\ndon’t interfere with Cissie Villa. I’m always right. I’m quite uneasy\r\nat being always right so often.”\r\n\r\n“It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s. Freddy doesn’t even know the\r\nname of the people he pretends have taken it instead.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. I’ve got it. Emerson.”\r\n\r\n“What name?”\r\n\r\n“Emerson. I’ll bet you anything you like.”\r\n\r\n“What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly. “I wish I had\r\nnever bothered over it at all.”\r\n\r\nThen she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,\r\nwhose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was\r\nthe proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch\r\nfrom the contemplation of her own abilities.\r\n\r\n“Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was\r\ndemocratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was\r\nnaturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact\r\nthat there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.\r\n\r\n“I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy”—she was\r\nsitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your\r\nmother’s a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s\r\naffectation to pretend there isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.\r\n\r\nShe was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see\r\nthe pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the\r\nWeald. The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this\r\nlateral view.\r\n\r\n“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no\r\nrelations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does\r\nthat satisfy you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he grumbled. “And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re\r\nfriends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country\r\nfamilies will be able to call in perfect safety.”\r\n\r\n“_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly. “Lucy, don’t screech.\r\nIt’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.”\r\n\r\n“But has Cecil—”\r\n\r\n“Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.\r\nAhem! Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’”\r\n\r\nShe got up from the grass.\r\n\r\nIt was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While\r\nshe believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry\r\nOtway, she had borne it like a good girl. She might well “screech” when\r\nshe heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a\r\ntease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in\r\nthwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss\r\nHoneychurch with more than his usual kindness.\r\n\r\nWhen she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the\r\nsame ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was\r\nstrange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation\r\nwhile she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don’t suppose it\r\nwill prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends\r\nof Mr. Vyse’s. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest\r\npeople! For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.\r\n“There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and\r\nfilled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have\r\nfailed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so\r\npleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories. ‘My dear\r\nsister loves flowers,’ it began. They found the whole room a mass of\r\nblue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet\r\nso beautiful.’ It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those\r\nFlorentine Emersons with violets.”\r\n\r\n“Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his\r\nsister’s face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe\r\nsaw it, and continued to divert the conversation.\r\n\r\n“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a\r\ngoodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very\r\nimmature—pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father—such a\r\nsentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.”\r\n\r\nIn his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,\r\nbut he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble. He repeated\r\nany rubbish that came into his head.\r\n\r\n“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “Lucy, don’t desert us—go\r\non playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been\r\nthe oddest place. That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being\r\nthere. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must\r\nask Charlotte here some time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his\r\nhostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was\r\nperfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same\r\nstory had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what\r\nwas the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in\r\nThackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.\r\n\r\nLucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.\r\n\r\n“I must go,” she said gravely. “Don’t be silly. You always overdo it\r\nwhen you play.”\r\n\r\nAs she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil\r\nair, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it\r\nright. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made\r\nher connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of\r\nnondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw\r\nthat for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely\r\ntruthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up\r\nthe garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe\r\nher, she was sure.\r\n\r\n“Cecil!”\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed\r\nin high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all\r\nbear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here. I, even I, have won a\r\ngreat victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith’s right—the cause of\r\nComedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have\r\nfound tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don’t be angry! Don’t\r\nbe angry! You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.”\r\n\r\nHe looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled\r\nher ridiculous forebodings at once.\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” she said. “Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose\r\nI must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!\r\nCertainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have\r\nnice friends of yours. But you oughtn’t to tease one so.”\r\n\r\n“Friends of mine?” he laughed. “But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!\r\nCome here.” But she remained standing where she was. “Do you know where\r\nI met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up\r\nto see my mother last week.”\r\n\r\n“What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously. “I don’t quite\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n“In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca\r\nSignorelli—of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they\r\nrefreshed me not a little. They had been to Italy.”\r\n\r\n“But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.\r\n\r\n“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country\r\ncottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I\r\nthought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their\r\naddress and a London reference, found they weren’t actual\r\nblackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—”\r\n\r\n“Cecil! No, it’s not fair. I’ve probably met them before—”\r\n\r\nHe bore her down.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man\r\nwill do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting\r\nwith his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.\r\nNo, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with\r\nme. There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things. I believe in\r\ndemocracy—”\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t,” she snapped. “You don’t know what the word means.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be\r\nLeonardesque. “No, you don’t!”\r\n\r\nHer face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t fair, Cecil. I blame you—I blame you very much indeed. You\r\nhad no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look\r\nridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that\r\nit is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.”\r\n\r\nShe left him.\r\n\r\n“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nNo, it was worse than temper—snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that\r\nhis own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not\r\nminded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value\r\neducationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who\r\nwas silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would\r\nbring them to Windy Corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not\r\ndisdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His idea of bringing the Emersons\r\nto Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through\r\nthe negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,\r\nmet Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were duly\r\noffended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held\r\nresponsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the\r\nnew-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as\r\nsoon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that\r\nshe permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his\r\nhead, to be forgotten, and to die.\r\n\r\nLucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows\r\nbecause there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but\r\nsettled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.\r\nNow that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and\r\nwere welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring\r\nwhom he would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to\r\nbring the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a\r\nlittle thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather\r\ngreater and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She was glad\r\nthat a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie\r\nVilla while she was safe in the London flat.\r\n\r\n“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept\r\ninto his arms.\r\n\r\nCecil, too, became demonstrative. He saw that the needful fire had been\r\nkindled in Lucy. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should,\r\nand looked up to him because he was a man.\r\n\r\n“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don’t know what I should do without you.”\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed. Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett. A\r\ncoolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not\r\ncorresponded since they parted in August. The coolness dated from what\r\nCharlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased\r\namazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval\r\nworld becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in\r\nthe Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in\r\nthe Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue\r\ntheir tour. Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs. Vyse was an\r\nacquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and\r\nMiss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned\r\nsuddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for\r\nLucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as\r\nfollows. It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.\r\n\r\n“TUNBRIDGE WELLS,\r\n“_September_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAREST LUCIA,\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your\r\nparts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing her\r\ntire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very\r\nwoebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a\r\ndoor open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He said his\r\nfather had just taken the house. He _said_ he did not know that you\r\nlived in the neighbourhood (?). He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup\r\nof tea. Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean\r\nbreast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who\r\nwill forbid him to enter the house, etc. That was a great misfortune,\r\nand I dare say you have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I\r\nremember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about\r\nit all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Believe me,\r\n“Your anxious and loving cousin,\r\n“CHARLOTTE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:\r\n\r\n“BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR CHARLOTTE,\r\n\r\n“Many thanks for your warning. When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the\r\nmountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she\r\nwould blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,\r\nand cannot possibly tell her now. I have said both to her and Cecil\r\nthat I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable\r\npeople—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no\r\ntea was probably that he had none himself. She should have tried at the\r\nRectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that\r\nit would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,\r\nthey would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they\r\nare not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.\r\nAs for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for\r\nmyself. They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the\r\nother day. We expect to be married in January.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy\r\nCorner at all, but here. Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your\r\nenvelope again. No one opens my letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yours affectionately,\r\n“L. M. HONEYCHURCH.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSecrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we\r\ncannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her\r\ncousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if\r\nhe discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? Miss\r\nBartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she was right. It had become a\r\ngreat thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and\r\nher lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.\r\n“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago. She tried to\r\ntell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady\r\nwho had smitten his heart at school. But her body behaved so\r\nridiculously that she stopped.\r\n\r\nShe and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis\r\nvisiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her no\r\nharm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society\r\nitself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,\r\nand it did her no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to\r\nscrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren\r\nof famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness\r\nthat impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One\r\nlaunched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself\r\nup amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini\r\nand Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London\r\ncareer would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren asked her to play the piano.\r\n\r\nShe played Schumann. “Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the\r\nquerulous beauty of the music had died. She shook her head and played\r\nSchumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it was\r\nresumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The\r\nsadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should\r\nnever be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of\r\nthe audience throb. Not thus had she played on the little draped piano\r\nat the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr.\r\nBeebe had passed to himself when she returned.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up\r\nand down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.\r\nMrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s,\r\nhad been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among\r\nmany people. The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had\r\nseen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her\r\nabilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he\r\nwas not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.\r\n\r\n“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end\r\nof each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.\r\n“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“Her music always was wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent\r\nHoneychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting\r\nservants, or asking one how the pudding is made.”\r\n\r\n“Italy has done it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy\r\nto her. “It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her next January.\r\nShe is one of us already.”\r\n\r\n“But her music!” he exclaimed. “The style of her! How she kept to\r\nSchumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right\r\nfor this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall\r\nhave our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest\r\ncountry folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and\r\nthen—not till then—let them come to London. I don’t believe in these\r\nLondon educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one\r\nhimself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.”\r\n\r\n“Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.\r\n\r\nAs she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s\r\nroom. Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought\r\nit kind to go herself. She found the girl sitting upright with her hand\r\non her cheek.\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.”\r\n\r\n“Bad dreams?”\r\n\r\n“Just dreams.”\r\n\r\nThe elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You\r\nshould have heard us talking about you, dear. He admires you more than\r\never. Dream of that.”\r\n\r\nLucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand. Mrs.\r\nVyse recessed to bed. Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.\r\nDarkness enveloped the flat.\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains,\r\nand the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.\r\nAll that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer\r\nStreet they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon\r\ndispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or\r\nof the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over\r\nhis Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.”\r\n\r\n“M’m.”\r\n\r\n“They might amuse you.”\r\n\r\nFreddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new\r\npeople might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just\r\nmoved in.\r\n\r\n“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe. “They are worth\r\nit.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to\r\nCissie Villa. “Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through\r\nwhich much squalor was visible.\r\n\r\nA grave voice replied, “Hullo!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve brought someone to see you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be down in a minute.”\r\n\r\nThe passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed\r\nto carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The\r\nsitting-room itself was blocked with books.\r\n\r\n“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered. “Are they that\r\nsort?”\r\n\r\n“I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment. What have they\r\ngot? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of\r\nAll Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.\r\nUm—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your\r\ngeneration knows its own business, Honeychurch.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.\r\n\r\nOn the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this\r\ninscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.”\r\n\r\n“I know. Isn’t it jolly? I like that. I’m certain that’s the old man’s\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“How very odd of him!”\r\n\r\n“Surely you agree?”\r\n\r\nBut Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on\r\nspoiling the furniture.\r\n\r\n“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.\r\n“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.”\r\n\r\n“The same as Lucy’s got.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?”\r\n\r\n“She came back yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose she had a good time?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book. “She and Cecil are thicker\r\nthan ever.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good hearing.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe ignored the remark.\r\n\r\n“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different\r\nnow, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.”\r\n\r\n“So will you.”\r\n\r\n“Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.\r\nCecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.\r\nThere are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. Cecil\r\nsays—”\r\n\r\n“What on earth are those people doing upstairs? Emerson—we think we’ll\r\ncome another time.”\r\n\r\nGeorge ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.\r\n\r\n“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.”\r\n\r\nThen Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. Perhaps he was\r\nshy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face\r\nwanted washing. At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do? Come\r\nand have a bathe.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was highly entertained.\r\n\r\n“‘How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.\r\n“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard. But I’m afraid\r\nit will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been\r\nintroduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How\r\ndo you do? Come and have a bathe’? And yet you will tell me that the\r\nsexes are equal.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly\r\ndescending the stairs. “Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe. I tell you they\r\nshall be comrades, and George thinks the same.”\r\n\r\n“We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.\r\n\r\n“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you\r\nplace in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no\r\nlonger despise our bodies.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.\r\n\r\n“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead. We despise the body less\r\nthan women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the\r\ngarden.”\r\n\r\n“I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass\r\nof philosophy that was approaching him.\r\n\r\n“I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to Nature\r\nwhen we have never been with her? To-day, I believe that we must\r\ndiscover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is\r\nour heritage.”\r\n\r\n“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at\r\nFlorence.”\r\n\r\n“How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George\r\nfor a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.\r\nMarriage is a duty. I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr.\r\nVyse, too. He has been most kind. He met us by chance in the National\r\nGallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I\r\nhope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal\r\nlandowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game\r\nlaws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to\r\nbathe. Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy. “I must—that is to say, I have to—have the\r\npleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“_Call_, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? Call on your\r\ngrandmother! Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return\r\nour calls before ten days have elapsed. I trust that you have realized\r\nabout the ten days’ interval. It does not count that I helped you with\r\nthe stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to\r\nbathe this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go and bathe, George. Why do you dawdle talking? Bring them back\r\nto tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you\r\ngood. George has been working very hard at his office. I can’t believe\r\nhe’s well.”\r\n\r\nGeorge bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of\r\none who has handled furniture.\r\n\r\n“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him. “It is only a pond,\r\ndon’t you know. I dare say you are used to something better.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of\r\nthe house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little\r\ntime the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes\r\nand philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing\r\nthe bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who\r\ncould not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition\r\nlooked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a\r\nword. He spoke of Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or\r\ndissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as\r\ninexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.\r\n\r\n“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize\r\nthat you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?”\r\n\r\n“I did not. Miss Lavish told me.”\r\n\r\n“When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of\r\nCoincidence.’”\r\n\r\nNo enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we\r\nsuppose. For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here\r\nnow, when one comes to reflect.”\r\n\r\nTo his relief, George began to talk.\r\n\r\n“It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate. We are flung\r\ntogether by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart. The\r\ntwelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—”\r\n\r\n“You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman. “Let me give you\r\na useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate. Don’t say, ‘I didn’t\r\ndo this,’ for you did it, ten to one. Now I’ll cross-question you.\r\nWhere did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?”\r\n\r\n“Italy.”\r\n\r\n“And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss\r\nHoneychurch?”\r\n\r\n“National Gallery.”\r\n\r\n“Looking at Italian art. There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence\r\nand Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our\r\nfriends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.”\r\n\r\n“It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George. “But you can call it\r\nItaly if it makes you less unhappy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he\r\nwas infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.\r\n\r\n“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is\r\nstill to write.”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nWishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that\r\nyou have come.”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“Here we are!” called Freddy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.\r\n\r\n“In there’s the pond. I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.\r\n\r\nThey climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,\r\nset in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain\r\nthe human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the\r\nrains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like\r\na beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.\r\n\r\n“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe. “No\r\napologies are necessary for the pond.”\r\n\r\nGeorge sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in\r\nseed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?”\r\n\r\nNo one knew, or seemed to care.\r\n\r\n“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of\r\nwater plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or\r\nbrittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe thought he was not.\r\n\r\n“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.\r\n\r\n“Water’s water,” murmured George. Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of\r\napathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were\r\na statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his\r\nmuscles. It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and\r\nwatched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes\r\nin either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.\r\n\r\n“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nThe bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed\r\nthe question properly.\r\n\r\n“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful,\r\nwater’s simply ripping.”\r\n\r\n“Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and\r\nsputtering at the sun.\r\n\r\n“Water’s wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.”\r\n\r\n“Apooshoo, kouf.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible,\r\nlooked around him. He could detect no parishioners except the\r\npine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other\r\nagainst the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and\r\nrural Deans receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these\r\nthings not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the\r\nintrusion of man?\r\n\r\n“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little\r\npile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.\r\n\r\nIt was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy\r\nsaid, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen\r\nrotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in\r\nGötterdämmerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or\r\nbecause the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of\r\nthe gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for\r\nsome reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and\r\nBotany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each\r\nother. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He was quiet: they\r\nfeared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out.\r\nHe smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked\r\nthem, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.\r\n\r\n“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the\r\nsunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to\r\nbathe a second time. Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.\r\n\r\nThey ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being\r\nIndians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get\r\nclean. And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the\r\nsward, proclaiming:\r\n\r\n“No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us\r\nshall all flesh turn in the end.”\r\n\r\n“A try! A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing\r\nit beside an imaginary goal-post.\r\n\r\n“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a\r\nkick.\r\n\r\n“Goal!”\r\n\r\n“Goal!”\r\n\r\n“Pass!”\r\n\r\n“Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.\r\n\r\nClothes flew in all directions.\r\n\r\n“Take care my hat! No, that’s enough, Freddy. Dress now. No, I say!”\r\n\r\nBut the two young men were delirious. Away they twinkled into the\r\ntrees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a\r\nwide-awake hat on his dripping hair.\r\n\r\n“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in\r\nhis own parish. Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a\r\nRural Dean. “Hi! Steady on! I see people coming you fellows!”\r\n\r\nYells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.\r\n\r\n“Hi! hi! _Ladies!_”\r\n\r\nNeither George nor Freddy was truly refined. Still, they did not hear\r\nMr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch,\r\nCecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.\r\nFreddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some\r\nbracken. George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down\r\nthe path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.\r\n\r\n“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. “Whoever were those\r\nunfortunate people? Oh, dears, look away! And poor Mr. Beebe, too!\r\nWhatever has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he\r\nmust lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though\r\nhe knew not against what. He led them now towards the bracken where\r\nFreddy sat concealed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path? Cecil,\r\nMr. Beebe’s waistcoat—”\r\n\r\nNo business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol\r\nand evidently “minded.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.”\r\n\r\n“This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.”\r\n\r\nThey followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant\r\nexpression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.\r\n\r\n“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared\r\na freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. “I\r\ncan’t be trodden on, can I?”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you! What miserable management! Why\r\nnot have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?”\r\n\r\n“Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and\r\nif another fellow—”\r\n\r\n“Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to\r\nargue. Come, Lucy.” They turned. “Oh, look—don’t look! Oh, poor Mr.\r\nBeebe! How unfortunate again—”\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface\r\ngarments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary\r\nGeorge, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.\r\n\r\n“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken. “I’ve\r\nswallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die—Emerson you\r\nbeast, you’ve got on my bags.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain\r\nshocked. “And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these\r\ncolds come of not drying thoroughly.”\r\n\r\n“Mother, do come away,” said Lucy. “Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.”\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.\r\n\r\nHe regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and\r\npersonable against the shadowy woods, he called:\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!”\r\n\r\n“Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Honeychurch bowed.\r\n\r\nThat evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the\r\npool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a call\r\nto the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose\r\ninfluence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nHow often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she had\r\nalways rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which\r\nsurely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she and\r\nGeorge would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of\r\ncoats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She\r\nhad imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or\r\nindifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.\r\nBut she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with\r\nthe shout of the morning star.\r\n\r\nIndoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she\r\nreflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree\r\nof accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the\r\nscenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the\r\nstage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too\r\nmuch. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.\r\nThat will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To\r\ngods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across\r\nthe rubbish that cumbers the world.\r\n\r\nSo ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was\r\nanother of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted\r\nto see him, and he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear\r\nabout hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He did\r\nnot want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and\r\nmade long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done. Lucy\r\nsoothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised\r\nwell for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser\r\nto discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed,\r\nthough not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains\r\nnothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded\r\nthe teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.\r\n\r\n“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter\r\nwith Cecil?”\r\n\r\nThe question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with\r\ncharity and restraint.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he’s tired.”\r\n\r\nLucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.\r\n\r\n“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering\r\ndispleasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”\r\n\r\n“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”\r\n\r\n“Cecil has told you to think so. You were devoted to her as a little\r\ngirl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid\r\nfever. No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”\r\n\r\n“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”\r\n\r\n“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing\r\ntrouble ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes\r\nhim sometimes seem—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets\r\nrid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.\r\n\r\n“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”\r\n\r\n“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way.\r\nNo. It is the same with Cecil all over.”\r\n\r\n“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was\r\naway in London.”\r\n\r\nThis attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch resented it.\r\n\r\n“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.\r\nWhenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to\r\ncontradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor\r\nintellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;\r\nyour father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly\r\nremember.”\r\n\r\n“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does\r\nnot mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset\r\nhim—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”\r\n\r\n“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“Then why didn’t he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and\r\nspoiling everyone’s pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy. Something had\r\nenfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so\r\nperfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two\r\ncivilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was\r\ndazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all\r\ncivilization had blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only\r\ncatchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a\r\nwhisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from\r\nthe comic song.\r\n\r\nShe remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her\r\nfrock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made\r\nthings no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to\r\nbe supercilious, and he had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished\r\nthat the trouble could have come at any other time.\r\n\r\n“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”\r\n\r\n“All right, mother—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced\r\nnorth, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the\r\nwinter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the\r\nlanding window with depression. No definite problem menaced her, but\r\nshe sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It\r\nseemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought\r\nnot to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter. She must be more careful;\r\nher mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was\r\nabout. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding\r\nupstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.\r\n\r\n“I say, those are topping people.”\r\n\r\n“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take\r\nthem bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right\r\nfor you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You\r\nforget the place is growing half suburban.”\r\n\r\n“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this\r\nmuddle.”\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with the court? They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve\r\nordered new balls.”\r\n\r\n“I meant _it’s_ better not. I really mean it.”\r\n\r\nHe seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the\r\npassage. She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with\r\ntemper. Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they\r\nimpeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch\r\nopened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making! I have\r\nsomething to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from\r\nCharlotte?” and Freddy ran away.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I really can’t stop. I must dress too.”\r\n\r\n“How’s Charlotte?”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy!”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate girl returned.\r\n\r\n“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.\r\nDid Charlotte mention her boiler?”\r\n\r\n“Her _what?_”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and\r\nher bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly. “I\r\nshall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She did not. She said: “Come\r\nhere, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And,\r\nthough nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and\r\nWindy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.\r\n\r\nSo the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner.\r\nAt the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one\r\nmember or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised\r\ntheir methods—perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own.\r\n\r\nDinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew\r\nup their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry.\r\nNothing untoward occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:\r\n\r\n“Lucy, what’s Emerson like?”\r\n\r\n“I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?”\r\n\r\n“Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.”\r\n\r\n“He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.\r\n\r\nFreddy looked at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her\r\nletter.”\r\n\r\n“One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get\r\nthrough the meal without a lie. “Among other things, that an awful\r\nfriend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if\r\nshe’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.”\r\n\r\n“She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one,\r\nfor nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands\r\nof females. She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those\r\nwomen who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek\r\nnotoriety by print. Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let\r\nthem be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while\r\nCecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,”\r\nwith his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s\r\nwrath. But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to\r\ngather in the darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original\r\nghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it\r\ncould be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.\r\nBut it had begotten a spectral family—Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s\r\nletter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was\r\nbound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who\r\nreturned now, and with appalling vividness.\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s. How is\r\nshe?”\r\n\r\n“I tore the thing up.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t she say how she was? How does she sound? Cheerful?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler. I know myself how water\r\npreys upon one’s mind. I would rather anything else—even a misfortune\r\nwith the meat.”\r\n\r\nCecil laid his hand over his eyes.\r\n\r\n“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the\r\nspirit of her remark rather than the substance.\r\n\r\n“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we\r\ncould squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday\r\nwhile the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor\r\nCharlotte for so long.”\r\n\r\nIt was more than her nerves could stand. And she could not protest\r\nviolently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.\r\n\r\n“Mother, no!” she pleaded. “It’s impossible. We can’t have Charlotte on\r\nthe top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is. Freddy’s\r\ngot a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take\r\nin Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can’t be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! It can.”\r\n\r\n“If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Minnie can sleep with you.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t have her.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again\r\nlaying his hand over his eyes.\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy. “I don’t want to make difficulties,\r\nbut it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.”\r\n\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\n“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t. And no more does Cecil. She gets on our nerves. You\r\nhaven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be,\r\nthough so good. So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but\r\nspoil us by not asking her to come.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” said Cecil.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling\r\nthan she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of\r\nyou two. You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of\r\nbeautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and\r\nplumbers. You are young, dears, and however clever young people are,\r\nand however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels\r\nlike to grow old.”\r\n\r\nCecil crumbled his bread.\r\n\r\n“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on\r\nmy bike,” put in Freddy. “She thanked me for coming till I felt like\r\nsuch a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea\r\njust right.”\r\n\r\n“I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this\r\ndifficulty when we try to give her some little return.”\r\n\r\nBut Lucy hardened her heart. It was no good being kind to Miss\r\nBartlett. She had tried herself too often and too recently. One might\r\nlay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss\r\nBartlett nor any one else upon earth. She was reduced to saying: “I\r\ncan’t help it, mother. I don’t like Charlotte. I admit it’s horrid of\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“From your own account, you told her as much.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly. She flurried—”\r\n\r\nThe ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping\r\nthe places she had known as a child. The Sacred Lake would never be the\r\nsame again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy\r\nCorner. How would she fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible\r\nworld faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.\r\n\r\n“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said\r\nCecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the\r\nadmirable cooking.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because\r\nin point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I\r\ndon’t care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.”\r\n\r\nCecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers,\r\nhydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact. “May me and Lucy\r\nget down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.\r\n“We don’t want no dessert.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Miss Bartlett accepted. And, equally of course, she felt sure\r\nthat she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior\r\nspare room—something with no view, anything. Her love to Lucy. And,\r\nequally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nLucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only\r\nfaced the situation that encompassed her. She never gazed inwards. If\r\nat times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to\r\nnerves. When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset\r\nher nerves. Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might\r\nupset her nerves. She was nervous at night. When she talked to\r\nGeorge—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved\r\nher deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she\r\nreally wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to\r\nnerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us. Once she had\r\nsuffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t\r\nknow what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet\r\nafternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young\r\nEmerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious. Life is\r\neasy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves”\r\nor any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire. She loved\r\nCecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the\r\nphrases should have been reversed?\r\n\r\nBut the external situation—she will face that bravely.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough. Standing between\r\nMr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy,\r\nand George had replied. She was anxious to show that she was not shy,\r\nand was glad that he did not seem shy either.\r\n\r\n“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his\r\ncrudities in time. I rather mistrust young men who slip into life\r\ngracefully.”\r\n\r\nLucy said, “He seems in better spirits. He laughs more.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the clergyman. “He is waking up.”\r\n\r\nThat was all. But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and\r\nshe entertained an image that had physical beauty. In spite of the\r\nclearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival. She\r\nwas due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch drove to meet her. She arrived at the London and Brighton\r\nstation, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy and\r\nhis friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a\r\nsolid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with\r\nlittle Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper\r\nlawn for tea.\r\n\r\n“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising\r\nfrom her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain. “I\r\nhave upset everything. Bursting in on young people! But I insist on\r\npaying for my cab up. Grant that, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her\r\nbrother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown\r\nunsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been\r\ntrying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.”\r\n\r\n“I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and\r\nlooked at her frayed glove.\r\n\r\n“All right, if you’d really rather. Five shillings, and I gave a bob to\r\nthe driver.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett looked in her purse. Only sovereigns and pennies. Could\r\nany one give her change? Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four\r\nhalf-crowns. Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But\r\nwho am I to give the sovereign to?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.\r\n\r\n“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not\r\nhampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the\r\nprompt settling of accounts.”\r\n\r\nHere Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need\r\nbe quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid. A\r\nsolution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously\r\ndrinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance,\r\nand turned round.\r\n\r\nBut this did not do, either.\r\n\r\n“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me\r\nwretched. I should practically be robbing the one who lost.”\r\n\r\n“Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil. “So it will work\r\nout right if you give the pound to me.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously. “How is that, Mr.\r\nVyse?”\r\n\r\n“Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab. Give me the pound, and\r\nwe shall avoid this deplorable gambling.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered\r\nup the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.\r\nFor a moment Cecil was happy. He was playing at nonsense among his\r\npeers. Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had\r\nmarred the smiles. In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this\r\nstupefying twaddle.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched\r\nthe iniquitous transaction. “I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the\r\nquid.”\r\n\r\n“Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.\r\n“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see—”\r\n\r\nThey tried to stifle her with cake.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. I’m done. I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me. Miss\r\nHoneychurch, your brother’s hurting me. Ow! What about Mr. Floyd’s ten\r\nshillings? Ow! No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss\r\nWhat’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.”\r\n\r\n“I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening. “Thank\r\nyou, dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me\r\nchange for half a crown?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.\r\n\r\n“Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I’ll get\r\nEuphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the\r\nbeginning.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed\r\nher across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity. When they\r\nwere out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite\r\nbriskly: “Have you told him about him yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue\r\nfor understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. “Let me see—a\r\nsovereign’s worth of silver.”\r\n\r\nShe escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were\r\ntoo uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke\r\nor caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had\r\nbeen a ruse to surprise the soul.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.\r\n“I promised you I shouldn’t. Here is your money—all shillings, except\r\ntwo half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.\r\nJohn ascending, which had been framed.\r\n\r\n“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse\r\nshould come to hear of it from some other source.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “George\r\nEmerson is all right, and what other source is there?”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett considered. “For instance, the driver. I saw him looking\r\nthrough the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”\r\n\r\nLucy shuddered a little. “We shall get the silly affair on our nerves\r\nif we aren’t careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold\r\nof Cecil?”\r\n\r\n“We must think of every possibility.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s all right.”\r\n\r\n“Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he is certain to know.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but\r\neven if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“To contradict it?”\r\n\r\n“No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not\r\ntrust him, for he desired her untouched.\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to\r\nwhat they were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully. “You kind, anxious\r\nthing. What _would_ you have me do? First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and\r\nthen you say, ‘Tell’. Which is it to be? Quick!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I\r\nblush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able\r\nto look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You\r\nwill never forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don’t.”\r\n\r\nFor the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with\r\na teaspoon.\r\n\r\n“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have\r\nyou seen the young one yet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“We met at the Rectory.”\r\n\r\n“What line is he taking up?”\r\n\r\n“No line. He talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really\r\nall right. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it\r\nbluntly? I do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won’t be\r\nany nuisance, Charlotte.”\r\n\r\n“Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.”\r\n\r\nLucy paused. “Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that\r\nthere are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She\r\npaused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.\r\nThrough the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a\r\nnovel. It was a new one from Smith’s library. Her mother must have\r\nreturned from the station.\r\n\r\n“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head. I fell into\r\nall those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don’t think we\r\nought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a\r\nperson with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does;\r\nit makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t\r\nadmire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him,\r\nand has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He\r\nhas improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into\r\ntears. He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big\r\nrailways—not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa\r\nwas to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There! Now\r\nfor the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm. “Suppose we\r\ndon’t talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to\r\nhave a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.”\r\n\r\nLucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected an\r\nunfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one\r\ncannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly\r\npeople. She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the\r\nentrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of\r\nthem Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most\r\nof the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up\r\nthe green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of\r\nmist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the\r\nheights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves\r\nunchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in\r\neither arose the tinkle of church bells.\r\n\r\nThe garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which\r\nlay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent\r\nsounds, as of females preparing for worship. “The men say they won’t\r\ngo”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her,\r\nno nonsense”—“Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I\r\ntrespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she\r\nat all events was one for church.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by\r\nApollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies\r\nwhenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down\r\nat Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan;\r\non George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete\r\nthe catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned\r\npreviously. The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and\r\nmovement may engender shadow. But this book lies motionless, to be\r\ncaressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly,\r\nas though acknowledging the caress.\r\n\r\nPresently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her new cerise\r\ndress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. At her\r\nthroat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an\r\nengagement ring. Her eyes are bent to the Weald. She frowns a\r\nlittle—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not\r\nto cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may\r\nfrown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo\r\nand the western hills.\r\n\r\n“Lucy! Lucy! What’s that book? Who’s been taking a book out of the\r\nshelf and leaving it about to spoil?”\r\n\r\n“It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.”\r\n\r\n“But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.”\r\n\r\nLucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a\r\nLoggia. She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time\r\nto solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful\r\nhow little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like\r\nthe Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. Only this morning\r\nshe had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and\r\nCecil had said, “What! you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And\r\nthis too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view\r\nand the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely\r\nconceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.\r\n\r\n“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?”\r\n\r\nShe hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a\r\nSunday fluster.\r\n\r\n“It’s a special collection—I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar\r\nclinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice\r\nbright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book’s all warped.\r\n(Gracious, how plain you look!) Put it under the Atlas to press.\r\nMinnie!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.\r\n\r\n“Minnie, don’t be late. Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse,\r\nnever the carriage. “Where’s Charlotte? Run up and hurry her. Why is\r\nshe so long? She had nothing to do. She never brings anything but\r\nblouses. Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses! Minnie!”\r\n\r\nPaganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the\r\nRector’s niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn’t see\r\nwhy. Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? The young\r\nmen, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss\r\nBartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling\r\ndown the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but\r\nsovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely\r\nfrock! You put us all to shame.”\r\n\r\n“If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear\r\nthem?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and\r\nplaced herself with her back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,\r\nand then they drove off.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye! Be good!” called out Cecil.\r\n\r\nLucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church\r\nand so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had\r\nsaid that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to\r\noverhaul herself; she did not know it was done. Honest orthodoxy Cecil\r\nrespected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a\r\nspiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that\r\nmight grow heavenward like flowers. All that he said on this subject\r\npained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the\r\nEmersons were different.\r\n\r\nShe saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down\r\nthe road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie\r\nVilla. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father\r\nand son smoking in the garden.\r\n\r\n“Introduce me,” said her mother. “Unless the young man considers that\r\nhe knows me already.”\r\n\r\nHe probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them\r\nformally. Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how\r\nglad he was that she was going to be married. She said yes, she was\r\nglad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind\r\nwith Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic,\r\nand asked him how he liked his new house.\r\n\r\n“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;\r\nshe had never known him offended before. He added: “We find, though,\r\nthat the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.\r\nWomen mind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,”\r\nsaid George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. “He\r\nthought we should be artistic. He is disappointed.”\r\n\r\n“And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to\r\ngive it up. What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly. She must avoid\r\ncensuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,\r\nthough his name was never mentioned.\r\n\r\n“So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet\r\nit does seem so unkind.”\r\n\r\n“There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George,\r\nwatching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. “That’s exactly what I say. Why all\r\nthis twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?”\r\n\r\n“There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain\r\namount of light,” he continued in measured tones. “We cast a shadow on\r\nsomething wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to\r\nplace to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place\r\nwhere you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very\r\nmuch harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!”\r\n\r\n“Eh—?”\r\n\r\n“I see you’re going to be clever. I hope you didn’t go behaving like\r\nthat to poor Freddy.”\r\n\r\nGeorge’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would\r\nget on rather well.\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t,” he said. “He behaved that way to me. It is his\r\nphilosophy. Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of\r\nInterrogation first.”\r\n\r\n“What _do_ you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don’t explain. He\r\nlooks forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you\r\nmind tennis on Sunday—?”\r\n\r\n“George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish\r\nbetween Sunday—”\r\n\r\n“Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That’s\r\nsettled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so\r\npleased.”\r\n\r\nHe thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter\r\nabout in these days.\r\n\r\nShe turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the\r\nMiss Alans.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck. The\r\nkindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came\r\nout suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the\r\nmorning sun? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never\r\nspoken against affection.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett approached.\r\n\r\n“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.\r\n“You met her with my daughter in Florence.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of\r\nthe garden to meet the lady. Miss Bartlett promptly got into the\r\nvictoria. Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension\r\nBertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.\r\nIt was the old, old battle of the room with the view.\r\n\r\nGeorge did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was\r\nashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: “I—I’ll come up\r\nto tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house. Perhaps\r\nanything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went\r\nstraight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as\r\nclumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and\r\nneed help. To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the\r\nweakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at\r\nFlorence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.\r\n\r\n“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for\r\npeople if his son would talk to them. “George has been in such good\r\nspirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nLucy caught her cousin’s eye. Something in its mute appeal made her\r\nreckless. “Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then\r\nshe went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I\r\nknew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence\r\nescapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had\r\nsighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it\r\nwith disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a\r\ntune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the\r\nmelody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things. It was\r\nnot an exploit. He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her\r\nhand to her cheek. “He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did!\r\nBut he has not told. He will not tell.”\r\n\r\nShe longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between\r\nus two for ever. Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss\r\nBartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at\r\nFlorence, when they had knelt packing in his room. The secret, big or\r\nlittle, was guarded.\r\n\r\nOnly three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she interpreted\r\nher joy. She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so\r\nsafe. As he helped her out of the carriage, she said:\r\n\r\n“The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved\r\nenormously.”\r\n\r\n“How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,\r\nand had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy\r\nCorner for educational purposes.\r\n\r\n“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship\r\nwhich Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He\r\nhad no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.\r\n\r\n“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are. George Emerson is\r\ncoming up this afternoon. He is a most interesting man to talk to. Only\r\ndon’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing\r\nfor lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to\r\nher remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.\r\n\r\nLunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some\r\none had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not\r\nvisible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will\r\nnot last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to\r\nentertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she\r\nhad received a guarantee. Her mother would always sit there, her\r\nbrother here. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning,\r\nwould never be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they\r\nasked her to play. She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played\r\nfrom memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud\r\napproaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never\r\ngains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of\r\nfairyland. Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to\r\nget restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play\r\nus the other garden—the one in Parsifal.”\r\n\r\nShe closed the instrument.\r\n\r\n“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.\r\n\r\nFearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round. There\r\nGeorge was. He had crept in without interrupting her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without\r\na word of greeting, she reopened the piano. Cecil should have the\r\nParsifal, and anything else that he liked.\r\n\r\n“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps\r\nimplying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know\r\nwhat to do nor even what she wanted to do. She played a few bars of the\r\nFlower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.\r\n\r\n“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you\r\nhave a men’s four.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil. “I will not spoil the set.” He\r\nnever realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to\r\nmake up a fourth.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come along Cecil. I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s\r\nEmerson.”\r\n\r\nGeorge corrected him: “I am not bad.”\r\n\r\nOne looked down one’s nose at this. “Then certainly I won’t play,” said\r\nCecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing\r\nGeorge, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not\r\nplay. Much better not.”\r\n\r\nMinnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she\r\nwould play. “I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?”\r\nBut Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall\r\nback on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your\r\nfrock.”\r\n\r\nLucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She kept it\r\nwithout hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in\r\nthe afternoon. As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was\r\nsneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything\r\nup before she married him.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd was her partner. She liked music, but how much better tennis\r\nseemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit\r\nat the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to\r\nher the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her by his\r\nanxiety to win. She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at\r\nSanta Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that\r\nobscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to\r\nher: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win\r\nat tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had\r\nbegun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.\r\n\r\nAh, how beautiful the Weald looked! The hills stood out above its\r\nradiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South\r\nDowns, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara. She might be\r\nforgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.\r\nOne could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its\r\ninnumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence. Ah,\r\nhow beautiful the Weald looked!\r\n\r\nBut now Cecil claimed her. He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood,\r\nand would not sympathize with exaltation. He had been rather a nuisance\r\nall through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad\r\nthat he was obliged to read it aloud to others. He would stroll round\r\nthe precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.\r\nThree split infinitives.”\r\n\r\n“Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke. When they had finished\r\ntheir set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and\r\nreally everyone must listen to it. Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to\r\nhunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.\r\n\r\n“The scene is laid in Florence.”\r\n\r\n“What fun, Cecil! Read away. Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your\r\nenergy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point\r\nof being pleasant to him.\r\n\r\nHe jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are\r\nyou tired?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I’m not!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mind being beaten?”\r\n\r\nShe was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so\r\nshe answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a\r\nsplendid player, though. The light was behind you, and it was in my\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\n“I never said I was.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you did!”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t attend.”\r\n\r\n“You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house. We all\r\nexaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.”\r\n\r\n“‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.\r\n\r\nLucy recollected herself.\r\n\r\n“‘Sunset. Leonora was speeding—’”\r\n\r\nLucy interrupted. “Leonora? Is Leonora the heroine? Who’s the book by?”\r\n\r\n“Joseph Emery Prank. ‘Sunset. Leonora speeding across the square. Pray\r\nthe saints she might not arrive too late. Sunset—the sunset of Italy.\r\nUnder Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it\r\nnow—’”\r\n\r\nLucy burst into laughter. “‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed! Why it’s Miss\r\nLavish! It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under\r\nsomebody else’s name.”\r\n\r\n“Who may Miss Lavish be?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a dreadful person—Mr. Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?”\r\n\r\nExcited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.\r\n\r\nGeorge looked up. “Of course I do. I saw her the day I arrived at\r\nSummer Street. It was she who told me that you lived here.”\r\n\r\n“Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent\r\ndown to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean\r\nsomething else. She watched his head, which was almost resting against\r\nher knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening. “No wonder the\r\nnovel’s bad,” she added. “I never liked Miss Lavish. But I suppose one\r\nought to read it as one’s met her.”\r\n\r\n“All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her\r\ninattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. “Every one writes\r\nfor money in these days.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil—!”\r\n\r\n“It is so. I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”\r\n\r\nCecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and\r\ndowns in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. She\r\nhad dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer\r\nto the clang of his. Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black\r\nhead again. She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting\r\nto stroke it; the sensation was curious.\r\n\r\n“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?”\r\n\r\n“I never notice much difference in views.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Because they’re all alike. Because all that matters in them is\r\ndistance and air.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.\r\n\r\n“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says\r\nthat there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over\r\nour heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering\r\nthe novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.\r\n\r\n“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees\r\nand houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human\r\ncrowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural,\r\nfor the same reason.”\r\n\r\nLucy’s lips parted.\r\n\r\n“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up. Something gets\r\nadded to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those\r\nhills.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.\r\n\r\n“What a splendid idea!” she murmured. “I shall enjoy hearing your\r\nfather talk again. I’m so sorry he’s not so well.”\r\n\r\n“No, he isn’t well.”\r\n\r\n“There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil. “Also\r\nthat men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who\r\nremember them, even in small rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?”\r\n\r\n“None. Why?”\r\n\r\n“You spoke of ‘us.’”\r\n\r\n“My mother, I was meaning.”\r\n\r\nCecil closed the novel with a bang.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!”\r\n\r\n“I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”\r\n\r\n“I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day\r\nand seeing as far as Hindhead. It is the first thing that I remember.”\r\n\r\nCecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after\r\ntennis—he didn’t do. He would have strolled away if Lucy had not\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.”\r\n\r\n“Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.”\r\n\r\n“No—read away. I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read\r\nout loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.”\r\n\r\nThis struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him. It put their visitor in\r\nthe position of a prig. Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book. Cecil\r\nmust have his reading and anything else that he liked. But her\r\nattention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had\r\nbeen murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as\r\nfar as Hindhead.\r\n\r\n“Am I really to go?” asked George.\r\n\r\n“No, of course not really,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning. “Find me chapter two, if it isn’t\r\nbothering you.”\r\n\r\nChapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.\r\n\r\nShe thought she had gone mad.\r\n\r\n“Here—hand me the book.”\r\n\r\nShe heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to\r\nread—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.”\r\n\r\nHe took the book from her.\r\n\r\n“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone. Before her lay the rich\r\nchampaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village. The\r\nseason was spring.’”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose,\r\nfor Cecil to read and for George to hear.\r\n\r\n“‘A golden haze,’” he read. He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence,\r\nwhile the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets. All\r\nunobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’”\r\n\r\nLest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.\r\n\r\nHe read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as\r\nformal lovers use. No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the\r\nlack of it. He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another\r\nmuch funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.\r\n\r\n“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.\r\n\r\nShe led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last. She\r\nthought a disaster was averted. But when they entered the shrubbery it\r\ncame. The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been\r\nforgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved\r\npassionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.\r\n\r\n“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.\r\n\r\nAs if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they\r\nreached the upper lawn alone.\r\n\r\nBut Lucy had developed since the spring. That is to say, she was now\r\nbetter able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the\r\nworld disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by\r\ndeep sobs. She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I\r\nmust write some letters,” and went up to her room. Then she prepared\r\nfor action. Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our\r\nhearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we\r\nshall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must\r\nstifle it.\r\n\r\nShe sent for Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\nThe contest lay not between love and duty. Perhaps there never is such\r\na contest. It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first\r\naim was to defeat herself. As her brain clouded over, as the memory of\r\nthe views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to\r\nher old shibboleth of nerves. She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering\r\nwith the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been. Remembering\r\nthat she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused\r\nremembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been\r\nanything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him. The\r\narmour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man\r\nnot only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments Lucy was\r\nequipped for battle.\r\n\r\n“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin\r\narrived. “Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the\r\nbook, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“There is a scene in it. The hero and heroine make love. Do you know\r\nabout that?”\r\n\r\n“Dear—?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know about it, please?” she repeated. “They are on a hillside,\r\nand Florence is in the distance.”\r\n\r\n“My good Lucia, I am all at sea. I know nothing about it whatever.”\r\n\r\n“There are violets. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. Charlotte,\r\nCharlotte, how _could_ you have told her? I have thought before\r\nspeaking; it _must_ be you.”\r\n\r\n“Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.\r\n\r\n“About that dreadful afternoon in February.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was genuinely moved. “Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t\r\nput that in her book?”\r\n\r\nLucy nodded.\r\n\r\n“Not so that one could recognize it. Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“So you did tell?”\r\n\r\n“I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of\r\nconversation—”\r\n\r\n“But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?\r\nWhy did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell\r\nmother?”\r\n\r\n“I will never forgive Eleanor. She has betrayed my confidence.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you tell her, though? This is a most serious thing.”\r\n\r\nWhy does any one tell anything? The question is eternal, and it was not\r\nsurprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. She\r\nhad done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done\r\nharm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.\r\n\r\nLucy stamped with irritation.\r\n\r\n“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson;\r\nit upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again. Behind Cecil’s back.\r\nUgh! Is it possible that men are such brutes? Behind Cecil’s back as we\r\nwere walking up the garden.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done now? Can you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. Fancy if\r\nyour prospects—”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word. “I see now why you wanted me\r\nto tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that\r\nyou had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.”\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince. “However,” said the girl,\r\ndespising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done. You have put me\r\nin a most awkward position. How am I to get out of it?”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett could not think. The days of her energy were over. She\r\nwas a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that. She\r\nstood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the\r\nnecessary rage.\r\n\r\n“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.\r\nAnd who’s to give it him? I can’t tell mother now—owing to you. Nor\r\nCecil, Charlotte, owing to you. I am caught up every way. I think I\r\nshall go mad. I have no one to help me. That’s why I’ve sent for you.\r\nWhat’s wanted is a man with a whip.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.\r\n\r\n“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing. What’s to be _done?_ We women go\r\nmaundering on. What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?”\r\n\r\n“I always said he was a cad, dear. Give me credit for that, at all\r\nevents. From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a\r\nbath.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong! We’ve both made a\r\nmuddle of it. George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he\r\nto be left unpunished, or isn’t he? I want to know.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was absolutely helpless. Her own exposure had unnerved\r\nher, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. She moved\r\nfeebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels\r\namong the laurels.\r\n\r\n“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.\r\nCan’t you speak again to him now?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly would I move heaven and earth—”\r\n\r\n“I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously. “Will you\r\nspeak to him? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all\r\nhappened because you broke your word.”\r\n\r\n“Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\nReally, Charlotte was outdoing herself.\r\n\r\n“Yes or no, please; yes or no.”\r\n\r\n“It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George\r\nEmerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture. “No one will help me. I\r\nwill speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was\r\nwhat her cousin had intended all along.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below. “Found the lost ball? Good\r\nman! Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you! I admire you—”\r\n\r\nThey had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the\r\nrubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning\r\nto cumber her soul. Her anger faded at the sight of him. Ah! The\r\nEmersons were fine people in their way. She had to subdue a rush in her\r\nblood before saying:\r\n\r\n“Freddy has taken him into the dining-room. The others are going down\r\nthe garden. Come. Let us get this over quickly. Come. I want you in the\r\nroom, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, do you mind doing it?”\r\n\r\n“How can you ask such a ridiculous question?”\r\n\r\n“Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand. “I seem to bring nothing but\r\nmisfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded. She remembered their last\r\nevening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss\r\nBartlett’s toque on the door. She was not to be trapped by pathos a\r\nsecond time. Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.\r\n\r\n“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying. “The jam’s jolly good.”\r\n\r\nGeorge, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the\r\ndining-room. As she entered he stopped, and said:\r\n\r\n“No—nothing to eat.”\r\n\r\n“You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr.\r\nEmerson all he wants. Where’s mother?”\r\n\r\n“She’s started on her Sunday writing. She’s in the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. You go away.”\r\n\r\nHe went off singing.\r\n\r\nLucy sat down at the table. Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly\r\nfrightened, took up a book and pretended to read.\r\n\r\nShe would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She just said: “I\r\ncan’t have it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you. Go out of this\r\nhouse, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing\r\nas she spoke and pointing to the door. “I hate a row. Go please.”\r\n\r\n“What—”\r\n\r\n“No discussion.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t—”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “Go, please. I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t\r\nmean that you are going to marry that man?”\r\n\r\nThe line was unexpected.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her. “You are\r\nmerely ridiculous,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\nThen his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse. He’s\r\nonly for an acquaintance. He is for society and cultivated talk. He\r\nshould know no one intimately, least of all a woman.”\r\n\r\nIt was a new light on Cecil’s character.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?”\r\n\r\n“I can scarcely discuss—”\r\n\r\n“No, but have you ever? He is the sort who are all right so long as\r\nthey keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.\r\nThat’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now. It’s\r\nshocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny\r\nhimself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a\r\ndifferent person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him first\r\nin the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced\r\nthe names of great painters. Then he brings us here, and we find it is\r\nto play some silly trick on a kind neighbour. That is the man all\r\nover—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he\r\ncan find. Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and\r\nteaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to\r\nsettle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren’t\r\nlet a woman decide. He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand\r\nyears. Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s\r\ncharming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly;\r\nand you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.\r\nSo it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the\r\nwhole of this afternoon. Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’\r\nbecause the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more\r\nself-control. I’m not ashamed. I don’t apologize. But it has frightened\r\nyou, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have\r\ntold me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But\r\ntherefore—therefore I settled to fight him.”\r\n\r\nLucy thought of a very good remark.\r\n\r\n“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for\r\nsuggesting that you have caught the habit.”\r\n\r\nAnd he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary. “I’m the same kind\r\nof brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep,\r\nand men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the\r\ngarden. But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He\r\nthought. “Yes—really in a better way. I want you to have your own\r\nthoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards\r\nher. “Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as\r\nyou came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I\r\nhave cared for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, ‘No\r\ngood,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again\r\nwhen all the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the\r\nwood I saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and\r\nhave my chance of joy.”\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm. “Does he not\r\nmatter? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no\r\nimportance, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nBut he stretched his arms over the table towards her.\r\n\r\n“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?”\r\n\r\nHe said: “It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.” And as if\r\nhe had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some\r\nportent against the skies of the evening. “You wouldn’t stop us this\r\nsecond time if you understood,” he said. “I have been into the dark,\r\nand I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.”\r\n\r\nHer long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though\r\ndemolishing some invisible obstacle. She did not answer.\r\n\r\n“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the\r\nfloor and preparing to go. “It is being certain that Lucy cares for me\r\nreally. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.”\r\n\r\nIn silence the two women watched him. His last remark, they knew, was\r\nnonsense, but was he going after it or not? Would not he, the cad, the\r\ncharlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He was apparently\r\ncontent. He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they\r\nlooked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin\r\nto climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues\r\nwere loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”\r\n\r\nLucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she said.\r\n“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the\r\nlatter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I\r\nthink, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:\r\n\r\n“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is\r\nit? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.\r\nBut you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go down to them.”\r\n\r\nBut, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,\r\nbut the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.\r\nSummer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the\r\nmore pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something\r\nor other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced\r\npast her, while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was\r\nhastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over\r\nWindy Corner?\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Lucy! There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll\r\nhurry.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson has had to go.”\r\n\r\n“What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,\r\nthere’s a good chap. It’s Floyd’s last day. Do play tennis with us,\r\njust this once.”\r\n\r\nCecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete. As you well\r\nremarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for\r\nanything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not\r\ninflict myself on you.”\r\n\r\nThe scales fell from Lucy’s eyes. How had she stood Cecil for a moment?\r\nHe was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nHe was bewildered. He had nothing to say. He was not even angry, but\r\nstood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what\r\nhad led her to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nShe had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their\r\nbourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.\r\nFloyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably\r\nlingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things\r\nover. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to\r\nforget that there ever was such a foolish girl.”\r\n\r\nIt was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her\r\nvoice showed it.\r\n\r\n“Different—how—how—”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued,\r\nstill on her knees by the sideboard. “My Italian trip came too late,\r\nand I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to\r\ntalk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you. You aren’t like yourself. You’re tired, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once. “That is exactly like you. You\r\nalways think women don’t mean what they say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.”\r\n\r\n“What if I do? It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth. I can’t\r\nmarry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.”\r\n\r\n“You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed\r\nindignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches. But give me a\r\nmoment’s time.” He closed his eyes. “You must excuse me if I say stupid\r\nthings, but my brain has gone to pieces. Part of it lives three minutes\r\nback, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it\r\ndifficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.”\r\n\r\nIt struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation\r\nincreased. She again desired a struggle, not a discussion. To bring on\r\nthe crisis, she said:\r\n\r\n“There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things\r\nmust come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.\r\nIf you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to\r\nyou—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never\r\ncould play. I don’t understand a word you say.”\r\n\r\n“You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably\r\nselfish of you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you\r\nhave warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding at\r\nlunch—at least, you let me talk.”\r\n\r\n“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might\r\nhave known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of\r\ncourse, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have\r\nbeen feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt\r\ncertain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if\r\nI was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted\r\nto be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my\r\nmother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all\r\nour relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good\r\nmentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point. They have\r\nto-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently. “I cannot tell why,\r\nbut though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not\r\ntreating me fairly. It’s all too horrible.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the good of a scene?”\r\n\r\n“No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.”\r\n\r\nHe put down his glass and opened the window. From where she knelt,\r\njangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into\r\nit, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy\r\nor any one might be outside.” He obeyed. “I really think we had better\r\ngo to bed, if you don’t mind. I shall only say things that will make me\r\nunhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no\r\ngood talking.”\r\n\r\nBut to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment\r\nmore desirable. He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first\r\ntime since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living\r\nwoman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even\r\neluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of\r\ngenuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought\r\nto have refused you this last time, too.”\r\n\r\nHe began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed\r\nat his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It\r\nwould have made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing\r\nout all that was finest in his disposition.\r\n\r\n“You don’t love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it\r\nwould hurt a little less if I knew why.”\r\n\r\n“Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort\r\nwho can’t know any one intimately.”\r\n\r\nA horrified look came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you\r\nnot to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we\r\nwere only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always\r\nprotecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose\r\nfor myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t\r\nI be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through\r\nyou? A woman’s place! You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s\r\nconventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to\r\nher feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand\r\nbeautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap\r\nyourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me. I\r\nwon’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more\r\nglorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my\r\nengagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when\r\nyou came to people—” She stopped.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:\r\n\r\n“It is true.”\r\n\r\n“True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.\r\n\r\n“True, every word. It is a revelation. It is—I.”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true. I\r\nfell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad\r\nto Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.” She\r\nwithdrew a step. “I’m not going to worry you. You are far too good to\r\nme. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for\r\nthis: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you\r\nwouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have\r\nnever known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for my\r\nsilly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a\r\ndifferent person: new thoughts—even a new voice—”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with\r\nincontrollable anger.\r\n\r\n“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.\r\n\r\nThen she lost her balance. She cried: “If you think I am in love with\r\nsome one else, you are very much mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I don’t think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you do think it. It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept\r\nEurope back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If a\r\ngirl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone\r\nelse in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting,\r\nbrutal! As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.”\r\n\r\nHe answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past. I shall\r\nnever say it again. You have taught me better.”\r\n\r\nShe began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.\r\n\r\n“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no\r\n‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity. I beg your pardon most humbly\r\nif my words suggested that there was. I only meant that there was a\r\nforce in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Cecil, that will do. Don’t apologize to me. It was my\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\n“It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals,\r\nand yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,\r\nand all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke. “I must\r\nactually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really\r\nam. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake\r\nhands?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the\r\ncurtains. “Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That’s all right. I’m sorry\r\nabout it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.”\r\n\r\n“Let me light your candle, shall I?”\r\n\r\nThey went into the hall.\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Cecil.”\r\n\r\nShe watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters\r\npassed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused\r\nstrong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.\r\nFor all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his\r\nlove became him like the leaving of it.\r\n\r\nShe could never marry. In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.\r\nCecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must\r\nbe one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for\r\nliberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that\r\nGeorge had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable\r\nrelease, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.\r\n\r\nShe put out the lamp.\r\n\r\nIt did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel. She gave\r\nup trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the\r\nbenighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to\r\ntheir destiny by catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious\r\nfolk. But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy\r\nwithin. They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be\r\ntheir strife after virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their\r\npleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism,\r\ntheir unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort\r\nwherever they go. They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas\r\nAthene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary\r\ncourse of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.\r\n\r\nLucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not\r\nlove him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one. The night\r\nreceived her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.\r\n\r\nLying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants\r\n\r\nWindy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred\r\nfeet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great\r\nbuttresses that supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow\r\nravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the\r\nleft ran the highway into the Weald.\r\n\r\nWhenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble\r\ndispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy\r\nCorner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so\r\ncommonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had\r\naffected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his\r\nmoney, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,\r\nshaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and\r\nwatch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent—and yet the\r\nhouse “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings\r\nhonestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive\r\narchitects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all\r\nthese suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner\r\nseemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might\r\nlaugh at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling\r\nover this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from\r\nthe Miss Alans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to\r\nCissie Villa, had changed their plans. They were going to Greece\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine,\r\n“we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course,\r\nAthens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive\r\nbread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting\r\nfirst into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English\r\nChurch?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go\r\nany further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable\r\npension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.”\r\n\r\nLucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe\r\ngreeted Windy Corner was partly for her. She would see the fun of it,\r\nand some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty. Though she was\r\nhopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that\r\ncerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or\r\nshe could not play the piano as she did. He had a theory that musicians\r\nare incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they\r\nwant and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their\r\nfriends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet\r\nbeen understood. This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been\r\nillustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only\r\nriding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether\r\nMiss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies\r\nto visit Athens.\r\n\r\nA carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught\r\nsight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped\r\nabruptly when it reached the main road. Therefore it must be the horse,\r\nwho always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.\r\nThe door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe\r\nrecognized as Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving;\r\nbut he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs. Cecil, who wore a\r\nbowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the\r\nstation. They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the\r\nsummit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.\r\n\r\nCecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.\r\n\r\n“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of\r\nMiss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it. “Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it\r\nromance? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are taken\r\nin a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.”\r\n\r\nCecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused\r\nand interested.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you\r\ndo nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while\r\nthe Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against\r\nthe terrible thing. ‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’\r\nSo they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension\r\nwith magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland\r\nforlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the\r\nPension Keats.”\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you\r\nany matches?”\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he\r\nspoke to the boy more kindly.\r\n\r\n“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven’t been to\r\nGreece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my\r\nfriends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don’t you\r\nthink so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is\r\nheroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in\r\neither case absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy—I\r\nam not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another\r\nfellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a\r\ncigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. “I was saying, if\r\nour poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be\r\nItalian. Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine\r\nChapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But\r\nnot the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here\r\ncomes the victoria.”\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right,” said Cecil. “Greece is not for our little lot”;\r\nand he got in. Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he\r\ntrusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really. And before they had gone a\r\ndozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box,\r\nwhich had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you\r\nonly talked about books. Cecil’s hard hit. Lucy won’t marry him. If\r\nyou’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n“But when—”\r\n\r\n“Late last night. I must go.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they won’t want me down there.”\r\n\r\n“No—go on. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle\r\nof his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.\r\nOh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he\r\nnegotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was\r\nagain as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.\r\n\r\nHe would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He hesitated\r\na moment, but went down the garden as requested. There he found a\r\nmournful company. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and\r\nbroken the dahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them\r\nup, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of\r\nassistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a\r\nminute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look\r\nat my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the\r\nground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage\r\nhaving to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give\r\neveryone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.”\r\n\r\nEvidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.\r\n\r\n“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though\r\nconveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn\r\ngales.\r\n\r\n“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who\r\ndid not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.\r\nMinnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very\r\ndisagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings\r\nwould tear longways instead of across.\r\n\r\n“Come for a walk with me,” he told her. “You have worried them as much\r\nas they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I\r\nshall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, must you? Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when\r\nboth my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange\r\ncactus will go before I can get to it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss\r\nBartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about\r\nfor, either in the house or out of it.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she\r\nhad exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round\r\nand exasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden,\r\nthe orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the\r\ngarden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth\r\nof blossom.\r\n\r\n“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a\r\nmoment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will\r\nshe come with us?”\r\n\r\n“I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”\r\n\r\n“They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for\r\nbreakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has\r\ngone, and Freddy won’t play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house\r\nis not _at all_ what it was yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur. “Go and put on your boots.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively\r\npursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She stopped when he entered.\r\n\r\n“How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at\r\nthe Beehive. Would you come too?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I will, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.”\r\n\r\nLucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.\r\n\r\n“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom\r\nof his heart, he thought them silly little things.\r\n\r\nLucy passed into Schumann.\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had\r\nthought that she would like him to be told.\r\n\r\n“I needn’t say that it will go no further.”\r\n\r\n“Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for\r\neach person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.\r\n\r\n“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you\r\nhave done the right thing.”\r\n\r\n“So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.”\r\n\r\n“I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.”\r\n\r\n“So does mother. Mother minds dreadfully.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as\r\nmuch as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really\r\na ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not\r\nherself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.\r\n\r\n“And Freddy minds.”\r\n\r\n“Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he? I gathered that\r\nhe disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”\r\n\r\n“Boys are so odd.”\r\n\r\nMinnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea\r\nat the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.\r\nBeebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action,\r\nso after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an\r\nabsurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I\r\nthought it might amuse you all.”\r\n\r\n“How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. After\r\na few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with\r\n“Going abroad? When do they start?”\r\n\r\n“Next week, I gather.”\r\n\r\n“Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?”\r\n\r\n“No, he didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.”\r\n\r\nSo she did want to talk about her broken engagement. Always\r\ncomplaisant, he put the letter away. But she, at once exclaimed in a\r\nhigh voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans! How perfectly\r\nsplendid of them to go abroad!”\r\n\r\n“I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the\r\nIllyrian coast!”\r\n\r\nShe laughed heartily. “Oh, delightful! I wish they’d take me.”\r\n\r\n“Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel? Perhaps George Emerson\r\nis right. He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople. I have always longed to go to\r\nConstantinople. Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that\r\nthe Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the\r\nroads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm. She had\r\nalways longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed. He saw, to his\r\nsurprise, that she was apparently serious.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,\r\nafter Cissie Villa.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would\r\ngive anything to go with them.”\r\n\r\n“Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home\r\nthree months.”\r\n\r\n“She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement. “I simply\r\n_must_ go away. I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through\r\nher hair. “Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away? I didn’t realize at\r\nthe time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. I knew you’d understand.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch\r\nrepose in the bosom of her family? Cecil had evidently taken up the\r\ndignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that\r\nher family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she\r\naccepted the hint eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the\r\nidea and everything has calmed down.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.\r\n\r\n“No, not at all. Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you\r\nthe whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so\r\nmasterful. I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way. He would\r\nimprove me in places where I can’t be improved. Cecil won’t let a woman\r\ndecide for herself—in fact, he daren’t. What nonsense I do talk! But\r\nthat is the kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n“It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what\r\nI gather from all that I have known of you. I do sympathize and agree\r\nmost profoundly. I agree so much that you must let me make one little\r\ncriticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?”\r\n\r\n“But I must go somewhere!” she cried. “I have been worrying all the\r\nmorning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with\r\nclenched fists, and repeated: “I must! And the time I shall have with\r\nmother, and all the money she spent on me last spring. You all think\r\nmuch too highly of me. I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss\r\nBartlett entered, and her nervousness increased. “I must get away, ever\r\nso far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.”\r\n\r\n“Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out\r\nof the front-door. He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.\r\nWhen he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the\r\ntinkling of a Mozart Sonata.\r\n\r\n“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.\r\n\r\n“One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently\r\nmuch worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it. The\r\nmarriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she\r\ncould wind herself up to speak.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.\r\nHe had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he had put it to himself at\r\nFlorence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of\r\nmeaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. He\r\nassumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with\r\nher. Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.\r\n\r\nShe opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter\r\ndrop.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder.”\r\n\r\n“It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in\r\nSummer Street. It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal\r\nat the present moment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe raised his eyebrows. Death is a strong word—surely too\r\nstrong. There was no question of tragedy. He said: “Of course, Miss\r\nHoneychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she\r\nchooses. Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly. “Yet Freddy ought not to have\r\ntold even you. One cannot be too careful.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so.”\r\n\r\n“I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend,\r\nand—”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the\r\nexaggerated importance that they attach to words. A rector lives in a\r\nweb of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is\r\nthe less he will regard them. He will change the subject, as did Mr.\r\nBeebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people\r\nlately? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of\r\nthat pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been\r\nworking into one another’s lives. Two, three, four, six of us—no,\r\neight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch. We\r\nmust really give the Signora a testimonial.”\r\n\r\nAnd, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in\r\na silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. On the\r\nsummit they paused. The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last\r\nhour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.\r\nGrey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and\r\nshredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there\r\ngleamed a hint of the disappearing blue. Summer was retreating. The\r\nwind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for\r\nthose vast operations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking,\r\nbroken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural\r\nthat equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr.\r\nBeebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.\r\nNo smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said:\r\n“We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.\r\nThe darkness last night was appalling.”\r\n\r\nThey reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock. That amiable\r\nhostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do\r\ndearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant\r\nsanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that\r\nMiss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be\r\ndull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would\r\nhand the child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally\r\nenabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very\r\nmuch object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.\r\n“Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am\r\nabsolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. She has acted\r\nloftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we\r\nthink too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think\r\nof this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again. “I don’t know\r\nwhether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their\r\nmad career. It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to\r\nhesitate, and then read it again.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see the point of it myself.”\r\n\r\nTo his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you. In it\r\nI spy Lucy’s salvation.”\r\n\r\n“Really. Now, why?”\r\n\r\n“She wanted to leave Windy Corner.”\r\n\r\n“I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to\r\nsay—selfish.”\r\n\r\n“It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire\r\na change.”\r\n\r\nHere, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect\r\nmisses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another\r\nlady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps\r\nshe must have a change. I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand\r\nthese things. But why need she go as far as Greece?”\r\n\r\n“You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently\r\ninterested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “Why Greece?\r\n(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!\r\nI had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this\r\nmorning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already\r\nsaid too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with\r\nme at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.\r\n\r\n“But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on\r\nLucy’s nerves. Our tour was a failure. She wanted to leave Florence,\r\nand when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the\r\ntime I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.”\r\n\r\n“Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe. “I want\r\nyour advice.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to\r\nhim, though familiar to Lucy. “I for one will help her to go to Greece.\r\nWill you?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe considered.\r\n\r\n“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and\r\nwhispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.\r\n“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this\r\nodd woman really did know. “She must not stop here a moment, and we\r\nmust keep quiet till she goes. I trust that the servants know nothing.\r\nAfterwards—but I may have said too much already. Only, Lucy and I are\r\nhelpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone. If you help we may succeed.\r\nOtherwise—”\r\n\r\n“Otherwise—?”\r\n\r\n“Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.\r\n“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude. The tavern sign—a beehive\r\ntrimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked\r\nhim. Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did\r\nnot desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another\r\nman” that would have attracted a grosser mind. He only felt that Miss\r\nBartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be\r\ndelivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its\r\nvery vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. His belief in\r\ncelibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and\r\nculture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate\r\nflower. “They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So\r\nran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off\r\nbut with a slight feeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling\r\nwas intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go\r\nfurther—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her\r\nresolution of virginity. The feeling was very subtle and quite\r\nundogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in\r\nthis entanglement. Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action\r\nsubsequently, and his influence on the action of others. The compact\r\nthat he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only\r\nLucy, but religion also.\r\n\r\nThey hurried home through a world of black and grey. He conversed on\r\nindifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants;\r\nItalian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could\r\nliterature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly. “This comes of putting off. We\r\nmight have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to\r\ngo to Greece. I don’t know what the world’s coming to.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must. Come up to the\r\nhouse and let’s talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her\r\nbreaking with Vyse?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Freddy.\r\n\r\n“Good. Now come up to the house.”\r\n\r\nThey conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.\r\n\r\nLucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive\r\nand dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed. Nor would\r\nCharlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.\r\nBy his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a\r\nclergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he\r\nbent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she\r\nsaid; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right. It must be something I\r\ncan’t understand. Lucy! Let’s tell her. Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said. He opened the door, and\r\nheard the words of a song:\r\n\r\n“Look not thou on beauty’s charming.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.”\r\n\r\n“Sit thou still when kings are arming,\r\nTaste not when the wine-cup glistens——”\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s a song that Cecil gave her. How odd girls are!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.\r\n\r\n“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She went into the\r\ndrawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I\r\nwas so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.”\r\n\r\nRather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a\r\nbit.”\r\n\r\n“And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the\r\nMiss Alans will have you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, splendid! Oh, thank you!”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the\r\nkeys. She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother\r\nbent over her. Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the\r\nfloor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.\r\nOddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of\r\nthe past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_,\r\nin which people who care for one another are painted chatting together\r\nabout noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and\r\ntherefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to\r\nmarry or to travel when she had such friends at home?\r\n\r\n“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,\r\nSpeak not when the people listens,”\r\n\r\n\r\nshe continued.\r\n\r\n“Here’s Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he. “Go on.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly. “I forget why—harmony or\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“I suspected it was unscholarly. It’s so beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten. Why\r\nthrow up the sponge?”\r\n\r\n“How stupidly you talk!” said his sister. The _Santa Conversazione_ was\r\nbroken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about\r\nGreece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.\r\n\r\nFreddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual\r\nfelicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.”\r\n\r\n“Stop thine ear against the singer—”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute; she is finishing.”\r\n\r\n“From the red gold keep thy finger;\r\nVacant heart and hand and eye\r\nEasy live and quiet die.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I love weather like this,” said Freddy.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe passed into it.\r\n\r\nThe two main facts were clear. She had behaved splendidly, and he had\r\nhelped her. He could not expect to master the details of so big a\r\nchange in a girl’s life. If here and there he was dissatisfied or\r\npuzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.\r\n\r\n“Vacant heart and hand and eye—”\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly. He half\r\nfancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the\r\nshout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing\r\nthe words that it adorned:\r\n\r\n“Vacant heart and hand and eye\r\nEasy live and quiet die.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a\r\nbeacon in the roaring tides of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near\r\nBloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial\r\nEngland. They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and\r\nfor a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,\r\nmackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.\r\nThat there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them,\r\nfor they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken\r\nby those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores. Miss\r\nHoneychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.\r\nQuinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help\r\ntowards freshening up one’s face in the train. Lucy promised, a little\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\n“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse\r\nto help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to\r\ndrum nervously upon her card-case.\r\n\r\n“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine\r\ncontinued. “It is not every young man who would be so unselfish. But\r\nperhaps he will come out and join you later on.”\r\n\r\n“Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute\r\nand less kindly of the two sisters.\r\n\r\n“However, we shall see him when he sees you off. I do so long to see\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch. “She doesn’t\r\nlike it.”\r\n\r\n“No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Really? How funny! I should have thought that in this case—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going? It is such a pleasure to have\r\nmet you!”\r\n\r\nThey escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right. We just got\r\nthrough that time.”\r\n\r\nBut her mother was annoyed. “I should be told, dear, that I am\r\nunsympathetic. But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about\r\nCecil and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing,\r\nand almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is\r\nmost unpleasant.”\r\n\r\nLucy had plenty to say in reply. She described the Miss Alans’\r\ncharacter: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would\r\nbe everywhere in no time.\r\n\r\n“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?”\r\n\r\n“Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.\r\nI shall tell them then. It’s much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let’s turn\r\nin here.”\r\n\r\n“Here” was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must\r\ntake shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was\r\non the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a\r\nmythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses\r\nand gods.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, let it be shop, then. Let’s go to Mudie’s. I’ll buy a\r\nguide-book.”\r\n\r\n“You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so\r\nstupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this\r\nhole-and-corner work. You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m\r\nthankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not\r\nannounce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”\r\n\r\n“It’s only for a few days.”\r\n\r\n“But why at all?”\r\n\r\nLucy was silent. She was drifting away from her mother. It was quite\r\neasy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he\r\nhears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the\r\nincidental advantage of being true. But she could not say it. She\r\ndisliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that\r\nking of terrors—Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she had\r\ndeemed it unwise to reveal her soul.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent. She was thinking, “My daughter won’t\r\nanswer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than\r\nwith Freddy and me. Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she\r\ncan leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained\r\nunspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.”\r\n\r\nThis was perfectly true. Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when\r\nshe escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no\r\nlonger. It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought\r\nstraight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She\r\ndid not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself\r\nmust assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very\r\ninstruments of life. She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off\r\nmy engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece\r\nbecause I do not love George; it is more important that I should look\r\nup gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone\r\nelse is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and\r\nanxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she\r\nproceeded with the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I’m not tired of Windy\r\nCorner.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, mother! People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s. She\r\nbought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home;\r\nbut as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to\r\nbe away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my\r\nmoney next year.”\r\n\r\nTears came into her mother’s eyes.\r\n\r\nDriven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed\r\n“eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear. “I’ve seen\r\nthe world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so\r\nlittle of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket\r\nlike to-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with\r\nsome other girl.”\r\n\r\n“And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.\r\n“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. And\r\ncall it a Mission—when no one wants you! And call it Duty—when it means\r\nthat you can’t stand your own home! And call it Work—when thousands of\r\nmen are starving with the competition as it is! And then to prepare\r\nyourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.”\r\n\r\n“I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted\r\nsomething, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we\r\nhave not got it. She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those\r\nhad been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than\r\nshort skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her cue.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Take your independence and be gone. Rush up and down and\r\nround the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.\r\nDespise the house that your father built and the garden that he\r\nplanted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.”\r\n\r\nLucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed. “How you do remind me of Charlotte\r\nBartlett!”\r\n\r\n“_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid\r\npain.\r\n\r\n“More every moment.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very\r\nleast alike.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking\r\nback of words. You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among\r\nthree people last night might be sisters.”\r\n\r\n“What rubbish! And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you\r\nasked her to stop. I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you\r\nnot to, but of course it was not listened to.”\r\n\r\n“There you go.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.”\r\n\r\nLucy clenched her teeth. “My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked\r\nCharlotte to stop. I wish you would keep to the point.” And the\r\nconversation died off into a wrangle.\r\n\r\nShe and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train,\r\nlittle again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station. It had\r\npoured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes\r\nshowers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on\r\nthe hood. Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. Leaning forward,\r\nshe looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp\r\npass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing\r\nbeautiful. “The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she\r\nremarked. For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street,\r\nwhere she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on\r\nMr. Beebe’s old mother. “We shall have to sit three a side, because the\r\ntrees drop, and yet it isn’t raining. Oh, for a little air!” Then she\r\nlistened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That\r\nmelody was blurred by the soft road. “_Can’t_ we have the hood down?”\r\nshe demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well,\r\nold lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and\r\nPowell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs.\r\nHoneychurch’s neck. But now that the hood was down, she did see\r\nsomething that she would have missed—there were no lights in the\r\nwindows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw\r\na padlock.\r\n\r\n“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Have they gone?”\r\n\r\n“It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s\r\nrheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying\r\nto let furnished,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“They have gone, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss, they have gone.”\r\n\r\nLucy sank back. The carriage stopped at the Rectory. She got out to\r\ncall for Miss Bartlett. So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother\r\nabout Greece had been unnecessary. Waste! That word seemed to sum up\r\nthe whole of life. Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had\r\nwounded her mother. Was it possible that she had muddled things away?\r\nQuite possible. Other people had. When the maid opened the door, she\r\nwas unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a\r\ngreat favour: might she go to church? Mr. Beebe and his mother had\r\nalready gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her\r\nhostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a\r\ngood ten minutes more.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily. “I forgot it was Friday. Let’s\r\nall go. Powell can go round to the stables.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy dearest—”\r\n\r\n“No church for me, thank you.”\r\n\r\nA sigh, and they departed. The church was invisible, but up in the\r\ndarkness to the left there was a hint of colour. This was a stained\r\nwindow, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door\r\nopened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a\r\nminute congregation. Even their church, built upon the slope of the\r\nhill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of\r\nsilvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one\r\nnever talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.\r\n\r\nShe followed the maid into the Rectory.\r\n\r\nWould she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study? There was only that\r\none fire.\r\n\r\nShe would not object.\r\n\r\nSome one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a\r\ngout-stool.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw\r\nan alteration in him since last Sunday.\r\n\r\nNot a word would come to her lips. George she had faced, and could have\r\nfaced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! George is so sorry! He\r\nthought he had a right to try. I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he\r\nhad told me first. He ought not to have tried. I knew nothing about it\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\nIf only she could remember how to behave!\r\n\r\nHe held up his hand. “But you must not scold him.”\r\n\r\nLucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.\r\n\r\n“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love. I said: ‘When love\r\ncomes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind. No. Passion\r\nis sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever\r\nreally understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my\r\nday is over, and though there is the result. Poor boy! He is so sorry!\r\nHe said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that\r\nwhatever you felt you did not mean. Yet”—his voice gathered strength:\r\nhe spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?”\r\n\r\nLucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries. Holding it\r\nup to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any\r\nsubject connected with your son.”\r\n\r\n“But you do remember it?”\r\n\r\n“He has misbehaved himself from the first.”\r\n\r\n“I only was told that he loved you last Sunday. I never could judge\r\nbehaviour. I—I—suppose he has.”\r\n\r\nFeeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to\r\nhim. His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were\r\nsunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.\r\n\r\n“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said. “I am glad he is sorry. Do\r\nyou know what he did?”\r\n\r\n“Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction. “He only tried when he\r\nshould not have tried. You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are\r\ngoing to marry the man you love. Do not go out of George’s life saying\r\nhe is abominable.”\r\n\r\n“No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.\r\n“‘Abominable’ is much too strong. I am sorry I used it about your son.\r\nI think I will go to church, after all. My mother and my cousin have\r\ngone. I shall not be so very late—”\r\n\r\n“Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.\r\n\r\n“What was that?”\r\n\r\n“Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head\r\nfell on his chest.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“As his mother did.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr. Emerson_—what are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.\r\n\r\nLucy was frightened.\r\n\r\n“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when\r\nhe was twelve and she turned round. She thought it a judgement.” He\r\nshuddered. “Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and\r\nbroken away from her parents. Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than\r\ndeath, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted\r\nyour little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in\r\nagain! A judgement! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had\r\ndropped water on him in church! Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch? Shall\r\nwe slip back into the darkness for ever?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” gasped Lucy. “I don’t understand this sort of thing. I\r\nwas not meant to understand it.”\r\n\r\n“But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his\r\nprinciples. I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was\r\nwell she was ill. He made her think about sin, and she went under\r\nthinking about it.”\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.\r\n\r\n“He was not baptized,” said the old man. “I did hold firm.” And he\r\nlooked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what\r\ncost!—he had won a victory over them. “My boy shall go back to the\r\nearth untouched.”\r\n\r\nShe asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill.\r\n\r\n“Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present. “George last Sunday—no,\r\nnot ill: just gone under. He is never ill. But he is his mother’s son.\r\nHer eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful,\r\nand he will not think it worth while to live. It was always touch and\r\ngo. He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live. He will\r\nnever think anything worth while. You remember that church at\r\nFlorence?”\r\n\r\nLucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect\r\npostage stamps.\r\n\r\n“After you left Florence—horrible. Then we took the house here, and he\r\ngoes bathing with your brother, and became better. You saw him\r\nbathing?”\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair. I am deeply\r\nsorry about it.”\r\n\r\n“Then there came something about a novel. I didn’t follow it at all; I\r\nhad to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old. Ah,\r\nwell, one must have failures. George comes down to-morrow, and takes me\r\nup to his London rooms. He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be\r\nwhere he is.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my\r\naccount. I am going to Greece. Don’t leave your comfortable house.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled. “How good\r\neveryone is! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning\r\nand heard I was going! Here I am so comfortable with a fire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you won’t go back to London. It’s absurd.”\r\n\r\n“I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he\r\ncan’t. He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am\r\nnot justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t. I’ve been\r\nbother enough to the world by now. I can’t have you moving out of your\r\nhouse when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my\r\naccount. You must stop! I am just going to Greece.”\r\n\r\n“All the way to Greece?”\r\n\r\nHer manner altered.\r\n\r\n“To Greece?”\r\n\r\n“So you must stop. You won’t talk about this business, I know. I can\r\ntrust you both.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly you can. We either have you in our lives, or leave you to\r\nthe life that you have chosen.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t want—”\r\n\r\n“I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George? No, it was wrong of\r\nGeorge to try. We have pushed our beliefs too far. I fancy that we\r\ndeserve sorrow.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological\r\nblue. They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on\r\nthe tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. To Lucy who could\r\nnot see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from\r\nMr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful\r\nthat the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy,\r\nand be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.\r\n\r\nMore certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.\r\n\r\n“No, please sit still. I think I will sit in the carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.\r\n\r\n“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you. And what were you\r\nsaying about going abroad?”\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but\r\nyou were to be married this year, I thought.”\r\n\r\n“Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands. Would she\r\ntell an actual lie when it came to the point?\r\n\r\n“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you. I hope—it isn’t because\r\nGeorge spoke that you are both going?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church. His cassock was covered\r\nwith rain. “That’s all right,” he said kindly. “I counted on you two\r\nkeeping each other company. It’s pouring again. The entire\r\ncongregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my\r\nmother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did\r\nPowell go round?”\r\n\r\n“I think so; I’ll see.”\r\n\r\n“No—of course, I’ll see. How are the Miss Alans?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?”\r\n\r\n“I—I did.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the\r\ntwo Miss Alans? Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm. I think three\r\nis such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to\r\nthe stables.\r\n\r\n“He is not going,” she said hoarsely. “I made a slip. Mr. Vyse does\r\nstop behind in England.”\r\n\r\nSomehow it was impossible to cheat this old man. To George, to Cecil,\r\nshe would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so\r\ndignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account,\r\nand the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths\r\nthat he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry\r\nof sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the\r\nold—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was\r\nnot her companion to Greece. And she spoke so seriously that the risk\r\nbecame a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving\r\nhim? You are leaving the man you love?”\r\n\r\n“I—I had to.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?”\r\n\r\nTerror came over her, and she lied again. She made the long, convincing\r\nspeech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the\r\nworld when she announced that her engagement was no more. He heard her\r\nin silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you. It seems\r\nto me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the\r\nworld. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so\r\ndreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the\r\nthings that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I\r\nused to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know\r\nbetter now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware\r\nof muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be\r\nannoyed with me and weren’t? Do you remember before, when you refused\r\nthe room with the view? Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am\r\nfearing that you are in one now.” She was silent. “Don’t trust me, Miss\r\nHoneychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was\r\nstill silent. “‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance\r\non the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’\r\nI think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his functions as\r\nhe goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out\r\nexcitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love George!” And after\r\nhis long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from\r\nthe open sea.\r\n\r\n“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction. “You love the\r\nboy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other\r\nword expresses it. You won’t marry the other man for his sake.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.\r\n“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking\r\nabout a man.”\r\n\r\n“But you are.”\r\n\r\nShe summoned physical disgust.\r\n\r\n“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you. It’s the only hope at times.\r\nI can reach you no other way. You must marry, or your life will be\r\nwasted. You have gone too far to retreat. I have no time for the\r\ntenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that\r\nreally matter, and _for which_ you marry. I know that, with George, you\r\nwill find them, and that you love him. Then be his wife. He is already\r\npart of you. Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or\r\nforget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.\r\nIt isn’t possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You\r\ncan transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out\r\nof you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is\r\neternal.”\r\n\r\nLucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon,\r\nher tears remained.\r\n\r\n“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the\r\nbody, but of the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we\r\nconfessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul! Your\r\nsoul, dear Lucy! I hate the word now, because of all the cant with\r\nwhich superstition has wrapped it round. But we have souls. I cannot\r\nsay how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you\r\nruining yours. I cannot bear it. It is again the darkness creeping in;\r\nit is hell.” Then he checked himself. “What nonsense I have talked—how\r\nabstract and remote! And I have made you cry! Dear girl, forgive my\r\nprosiness; marry my boy. When I think what life is, and how seldom love\r\nis answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the\r\nworld was made.”\r\n\r\nShe could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. Yet as he\r\nspoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the\r\nbottom of her soul.\r\n\r\n“Then, Lucy—”\r\n\r\n“You’ve frightened me,” she moaned. “Cecil—Mr. Beebe—the ticket’s\r\nbought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair. “I’m caught in the\r\ntangle. I must suffer and grow old away from him. I cannot break the\r\nwhole of life for his sake. They trusted me.”\r\n\r\nA carriage drew up at the front-door.\r\n\r\n“Give George my love—once only. Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged\r\nher veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.\r\n\r\n“Lucy—”\r\n\r\n“No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—”\r\n\r\n“But why should they, when you have deceived them?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not worthy of their trust.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.\r\n\r\n“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?”\r\n\r\n“One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.\r\n\r\n“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson. To whom do you refer? Trust whom?”\r\n\r\n“I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George. They\r\nhave loved one another all along.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl. He was very quiet, and his white\r\nface, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. A long black\r\ncolumn, he stood and awaited her reply.\r\n\r\n“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.\r\n\r\nA look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!”\r\n\r\n“It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly. “It’s the part of people\r\nthat you don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“Lucy! Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe, could you help me?”\r\n\r\nHe looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am\r\nmore grieved than I can possibly express. It is lamentable,\r\nlamentable—incredible.”\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me. Marry\r\nGeorge, Miss Honeychurch. He will do admirably.”\r\n\r\nHe walked out and left them. They heard him guiding his mother\r\nup-stairs.\r\n\r\n“Lucy!” the voices called.\r\n\r\nShe turned to Mr. Emerson in despair. But his face revived her. It was\r\nthe face of a saint who understood.\r\n\r\n“Now it is all dark. Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.\r\nI know. But remember the mountains over Florence and the view. Ah,\r\ndear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.\r\nYou have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the\r\nmuddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your\r\nfriends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever\r\nright to despise. George still dark, all the tussle and the misery\r\nwithout a word from him. Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.\r\n“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.\r\nTruth counts, Truth does count.”\r\n\r\n“You kiss me,” said the girl. “You kiss me. I will try.”\r\n\r\nHe gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining\r\nthe man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.\r\nThroughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his\r\nsalutation remained. He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s\r\ntaunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.\r\nShe “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he\r\nmanaged to strengthen her. It was as if he had made her see the whole\r\nof everything at once.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves. They\r\nalone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of\r\nthe Saronic gulf. They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either\r\nshrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue\r\nseas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze\r\ncharioteer drives undismayed towards infinity. Trembling, anxious,\r\ncumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople,\r\nthey did go round the world. The rest of us must be contented with a\r\nfair, but a less arduous, goal. Italiam petimus: we return to the\r\nPension Bertolini.\r\n\r\nGeorge said it was his old room.\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had\r\nyour father’s room. I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.”\r\n\r\nHe knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.\r\n\r\n“George, you baby, get up.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.\r\n\r\nUnable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was\r\ntrying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and\r\nagain the spring.\r\n\r\n“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully. “What can such people be\r\nmade of?”\r\n\r\n“Same stuff as parsons are made of.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Quite right. It is nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism\r\nnext, and you stop laughing and being so silly.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and\r\nadvancing his face to hers. “What’s there to cry at? Kiss me here.” He\r\nindicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.\r\n\r\nHe was a boy after all. When it came to the point, it was she who\r\nremembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who\r\nknew whose room this had been last year. It endeared him to her\r\nstrangely that he should be sometimes wrong.\r\n\r\n“Any letters?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Just a line from Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“Now kiss me here; then here.”\r\n\r\nThen, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window,\r\nopened it (as the English will), and leant out. There was the parapet,\r\nthere the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills. The\r\ncab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might\r\nbe that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve\r\nmonths ago. A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the\r\nSouth—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things\r\nwho had taken so much trouble about a young fool. He had helped\r\nhimself, it is true, but how stupidly!\r\n\r\nAll the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his\r\nfather, by his wife.\r\n\r\n“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its\r\nname is, still shows.”\r\n\r\n“San Miniato. I’ll just finish your sock.”\r\n\r\n“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nGeorge told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away\r\non driving.\r\n\r\nAnd the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils,\r\nthe Miss Bartletts! Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the\r\nforces that had swept him into this contentment.\r\n\r\n“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\nHis own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the\r\nHoneychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past\r\nhypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.\r\n\r\n“What does he say?”\r\n\r\n“Silly boy! He thinks he’s being dignified. He knew we should go off in\r\nthe spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give\r\nher consent we should take the thing into our own hands. They had fair\r\nwarning, and now he calls it an elopement. Ridiculous boy—”\r\n\r\n“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”\r\n\r\n“But it will all come right in the end. He has to build us both up from\r\nthe beginning again. I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so\r\ncynical about women. He has, for the second time, quite altered. Why\r\nwill men have theories about women? I haven’t any about men. I wish,\r\ntoo, that Mr. Beebe—”\r\n\r\n“You may well wish that.”\r\n\r\n“He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us\r\nagain. I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner. I\r\nwish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us\r\nare sure to come back to us in the long run.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only\r\nthing I did do—and you came back to me. So possibly you know.” He\r\nturned back into the room. “Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to\r\nthe window, so that she, too, saw all the view. They sank upon their\r\nknees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one\r\nanother’s names. Ah! it was worth while; it was the great joy that they\r\nhad expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.\r\nThey were silent.\r\n\r\n“Signorino, domani faremo—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, bother that man!”\r\n\r\nBut Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be\r\nrude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.\r\nEager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte. How cruel she would be\r\nto a man like that!”\r\n\r\n“Look at the lights going over the bridge.”\r\n\r\n“But this room reminds me of Charlotte. How horrible to grow old in\r\nCharlotte’s way! To think that evening at the rectory that she\r\nshouldn’t have heard your father was in the house. For she would have\r\nstopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have\r\nmade me see sense. You couldn’t have made me. When I am very happy”—she\r\nkissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs. If Charlotte had\r\nonly known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone\r\nto silly Greece, and become different for ever.”\r\n\r\n“But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely. He\r\nsaid so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, she didn’t see him. She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe,\r\ndon’t you remember, and then went straight to the church. She said so.”\r\n\r\nGeorge was obstinate again. “My father,” said he, “saw her, and I\r\nprefer his word. He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his\r\neyes, and there was Miss Bartlett. A few minutes before you came in.\r\nShe was turning to go as he woke up. He didn’t speak to her.”\r\n\r\nThen they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have\r\nbeen fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly\r\nin each other’s arms. It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett,\r\nbut when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting. George, who\r\ndisliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew. Then, why did\r\nshe risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nThey tried to piece the thing together.\r\n\r\nAs they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind. She\r\nrejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble\r\nmuddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the\r\nroar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words\r\nfell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?”\r\n\r\n“Mean what?”\r\n\r\n“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”\r\n\r\nLucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.\r\nSiamo sposati.”\r\n\r\n“Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\n“Buona sera—e grazie.”\r\n\r\n“Niente.”\r\n\r\nThe cabman drove away singing.\r\n\r\n“Mean what, George?”\r\n\r\nHe whispered: “Is it this? Is this possible? I’ll put a marvel to you.\r\nThat your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we\r\nmet, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of\r\ncourse, very far down. That she fought us on the surface, and yet she\r\nhoped. I can’t explain her any other way. Can you? Look how she kept me\r\nalive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after\r\nmonth she became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted\r\nher—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend. There\r\nare details—it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen,\r\nLucy, she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but\r\nin the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us\r\nhappy. We can never make friends with her or thank her. But I do\r\nbelieve that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and\r\nbehaviour, she is glad.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the\r\nexperiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.”\r\n\r\nYouth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited,\r\nlove attained. But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than\r\nthis. The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows\r\nof winter into the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A ROOM WITH A VIEW ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Out they toddled from rugged\r\nAvila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human\r\nhearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met\r\nthem in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great\r\nresolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s\r\npassionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed\r\nromances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to\r\nher? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,\r\nsoared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would\r\nnever justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the\r\nrapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the\r\nreform of a religious order.\r\n\r\nThat Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not\r\nthe last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for\r\nthemselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of\r\nfar-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of\r\na certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of\r\nopportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and\r\nsank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance\r\nthey tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but\r\nafter all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and\r\nformlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent\r\nsocial faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge\r\nfor the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague\r\nideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was\r\ndisapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.\r\n\r\nSome have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient\r\nindefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures\r\nof women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as\r\nthe ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might\r\nbe treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness\r\nremains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one\r\nwould imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite\r\nlove-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared\r\nuneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the\r\nliving stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and\r\nthere is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving\r\nheart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are\r\ndispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some\r\nlong-recognizable deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\nMISS BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSince I can do no good because a woman,\r\nReach constantly at something that is near it.\r\n                    —_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into\r\nrelief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she\r\ncould wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the\r\nBlessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as\r\nher stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain\r\ngarments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the\r\nimpressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our\r\nelder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually\r\nspoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her\r\nsister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely\r\nmore trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress\r\ndiffered from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its\r\narrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed\r\nconditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being\r\nladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not\r\nexactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired\r\nbackward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring\r\nor parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a\r\nclergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan\r\ngentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and\r\nmanaged to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a\r\nrespectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet\r\ncountry-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a\r\nparlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s\r\ndaughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made\r\nshow in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was\r\nrequired for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have\r\nbeen enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious\r\nfeeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have\r\ndetermined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s\r\nsentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to\r\naccept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea\r\nknew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;\r\nand to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,\r\nmade the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for\r\nBedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life\r\ninvolving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and\r\nartificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\r\nby its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might\r\nfrankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;\r\nshe was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing\r\nwhatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,\r\nto make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a\r\nquarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the\r\ncharacter of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\r\nhinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,\r\nvanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of\r\nthe sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since\r\nthey were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans\r\nat once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and\r\nafterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and\r\nguardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their\r\norphaned condition.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with\r\ntheir uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous\r\nopinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,\r\nand was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too\r\nrambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to\r\npredict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with\r\nbenevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as\r\npossible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite\r\nminds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax\r\nabout all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,\r\nconcerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in\r\nabeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and\r\nvirtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his\r\nway of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the\r\nmore for the time when she would be of age and have some command of\r\nmoney for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not\r\nonly had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but\r\nif Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s\r\nestate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\r\nseemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late\r\nconduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and\r\nof that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities\r\nof genteel life.\r\n\r\nAnd how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such\r\nprospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her\r\ninsistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a\r\nwary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead\r\nher at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and\r\nfortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick\r\nlaborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the\r\ntime of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,\r\nand of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife\r\nmight awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the\r\napplication of her income which would interfere with political economy\r\nand the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice\r\nbefore he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to\r\nhave weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic\r\nlife was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their\r\nneighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know\r\nand avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,\r\nwas generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and\r\ninnocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her\r\nreligion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,\r\nthe innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much\r\nsubtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of\r\nblazonry or clock-face for it.\r\n\r\nYet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by\r\nthis alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably\r\nreconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on\r\nhorseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the\r\ncountry, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she\r\nlooked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she\r\nallowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she\r\nenjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\r\nrenouncing it.\r\n\r\nShe was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it\r\nwas pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with\r\nattractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman\r\nappeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of\r\nseeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:\r\nSir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from\r\nCelia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for\r\nCelia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\r\nwould have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all\r\nher eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas\r\nabout marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the\r\njudicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that\r\nwretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his\r\nblindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits\r\nit would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome\r\nbaronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed\r\nuncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful\r\nmarriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and\r\ncould teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all\r\nthe more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some\r\nmiddle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself\r\ndreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for\r\nsuch a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s\r\nobjections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is\r\nto say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of\r\ngentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So\r\nMiss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\r\ndislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another\r\ngentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt\r\nsome venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,\r\nnoted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many\r\nyears to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also\r\nas a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views\r\nof his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication\r\nof his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be\r\nmeasured without a precise chronology of scholarship.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she\r\nhad set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the\r\npretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on\r\nfinishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted\r\nin), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to\r\npropose something, said—\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we\r\nlooked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six\r\nmonths to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at\r\nthem yet.”\r\n\r\nCelia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full\r\npresence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and\r\nprinciple; two associated facts which might show a mysterious\r\nelectricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s\r\neyes were full of laughter as she looked up.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or\r\nsix lunar months?”\r\n\r\n“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April\r\nwhen uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten\r\nthem till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you\r\nlocked them up in the cabinet here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a\r\nfull cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil\r\nin her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.\r\n\r\nCelia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in\r\nrespect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.\r\nAnd,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of\r\nmortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who\r\nwas stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.\r\nAnd Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore\r\njewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really\r\napplied herself to argument.\r\n\r\n“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\r\ndiscovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she\r\nhad caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of\r\ncourse, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But\r\nthe keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her\r\nhead and seemed to despair of her memory.\r\n\r\n“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long\r\nmeditated and prearranged.\r\n\r\n“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”\r\n\r\nThe casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread\r\nout, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,\r\nbut a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest\r\nthat was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in\r\nexquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.\r\nDorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her\r\nsister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the\r\ncircle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and\r\nshe could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.\r\n\r\n“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this\r\ncross you must wear with your dark dresses.”\r\n\r\nCelia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the\r\ncross yourself.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”\r\nsaid Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”\r\n\r\n“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I\r\nwould wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.\r\n\r\n“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\r\ncomplexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”\r\n\r\n“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so\r\nfond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need\r\ndiscuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”\r\n\r\nCelia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority\r\nin this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of\r\nan unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.\r\n\r\n“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will\r\nnever wear them?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to\r\nkeep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I\r\nshould feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with\r\nme, and I should not know how to walk.”\r\n\r\nCelia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a\r\nlittle tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit\r\nyou better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness\r\nof the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia\r\nhappier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed\r\na fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a\r\ncloud sent a bright gleam over the table.\r\n\r\n“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current\r\nof feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors\r\nseem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why\r\ngems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They\r\nlook like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful\r\nthan any of them.”\r\n\r\n“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice\r\nthis at first.”\r\n\r\n“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her\r\nfinely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on\r\na level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify\r\nher delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.\r\n\r\n“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\r\nbeginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,\r\nand also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than\r\npurple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing\r\nelse. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,\r\nletting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what\r\nmiserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She\r\npaused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce\r\nthe ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all\r\nthe rest away, and the casket.”\r\n\r\nShe took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking\r\nat them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at\r\nthese little fountains of pure color.\r\n\r\n“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with\r\nreal curiosity as to what she would do.\r\n\r\nDorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative\r\nadornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen\r\ndiscernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke\r\never attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I\r\nmay sink.”\r\n\r\nCelia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her\r\nsister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the\r\nornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea\r\ntoo was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the\r\npurity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with\r\nthat little explosion.\r\n\r\nCelia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the\r\nwrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked\r\nthat question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was\r\ninconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the\r\njewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a\r\nnecklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I\r\nshould be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,\r\nthough of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is\r\nnot always consistent.”\r\n\r\nThus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her\r\nsister calling her.\r\n\r\n“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great\r\narchitect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”\r\n\r\nAs Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her\r\nsister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw\r\nthat she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they\r\ncould remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the\r\nattitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had\r\nalways worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private\r\nopinions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un\r\ncaballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo\r\nque veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un\r\nas no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que\r\nrelumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don\r\nQuijote.”—CERVANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray\r\nsteed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is\r\nnothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something\r\nshiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that\r\nresplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling\r\nway, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s\r\nAgricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him\r\nyears ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet\r\nWordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at\r\nCambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined\r\nwith him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in\r\nthings, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,\r\nWordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every\r\nsense, you know.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of\r\ndinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the\r\nmass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man\r\nlike Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she\r\nthought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his\r\ndeep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the\r\nspare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different\r\nas possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type\r\nrepresented by Sir James Chettam.\r\n\r\n“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\r\n“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see\r\nif something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among\r\nmy tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”\r\n\r\n“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into\r\nelectrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of\r\nyour cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at\r\none time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can\r\nlet nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,\r\nand that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But\r\nyour fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you\r\ncan buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out\r\nhow men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in\r\nkeeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make\r\nyourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir\r\nJames had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had\r\noften thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was\r\nher brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was\r\nspeaking, and seemed to observe her newly.\r\n\r\n“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.\r\nBrooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all\r\nreading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas\r\nat one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in\r\ncircles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The\r\nfact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in\r\nfact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.\r\nI pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been\r\nin favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be\r\nlanded back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s\r\n‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous\r\nreason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such\r\nliterature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters\r\nlately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am\r\nfastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect\r\nreader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the\r\ninward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something\r\nlike the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\r\nmentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and\r\nconfusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution\r\nabout my eyesight.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\r\ndelivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make\r\na public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\r\noccasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\r\nconspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy\r\nslovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most\r\ninteresting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,\r\nthe Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the\r\nWaldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the\r\nhighest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to\r\nassist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted\r\nher above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\r\npolitical economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an\r\nextinguisher over all her lights.\r\n\r\n“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an\r\nopportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little\r\ninto the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a\r\nchestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw\r\nyou on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My\r\ngroom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention\r\nthe time.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not\r\nride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a\r\nlittle annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when\r\nshe wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\n“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that\r\nshowed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is\r\nshe not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.\r\n\r\n“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say\r\nsomething that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as\r\npossible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”\r\n\r\n“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\r\nself-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to\r\ndo what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.\r\nCasaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous\r\nmotive.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered\r\nDorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from\r\nhigh delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse\r\nSir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to\r\nlisten to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of\r\nallowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then\r\ninforming him that the Reformation either meant something or it did\r\nnot, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism\r\nwas a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist\r\nchapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\r\nspeaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.\r\n\r\n“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if\r\nto explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all\r\nschools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon said, “No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went\r\ninto Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the\r\nindependent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I\r\nbegan a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but\r\nwhen a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an\r\nanswer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your\r\ndocuments?”\r\n\r\n“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air\r\nof effort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but\r\neverything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is\r\nin A or Z.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said\r\nDorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects\r\nunder each letter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have\r\nan excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies\r\nmeddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some\r\nspecial reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in\r\nhis mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other\r\nfragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.\r\n\r\nWhen the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—\r\n\r\n“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”\r\n\r\n“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He\r\nis remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep\r\neye-sockets.”\r\n\r\n“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said\r\nDorothea, walking away a little.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”\r\n\r\n“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a\r\n_cochon de lait_.”\r\n\r\n“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard\r\nyou make such a comparison before.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good\r\ncomparison: the match is perfect.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.\r\n\r\n“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as\r\nif they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul\r\nin a man’s face.”\r\n\r\n“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of\r\ndecision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on\r\nBiblical Cosmology.”\r\n\r\n“He talks very little,” said Celia\r\n\r\n“There is no one for him to talk to.”\r\n\r\nCelia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I\r\nbelieve she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She\r\nhad never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.\r\nSometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a\r\nhusband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in\r\nthe depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too\r\nreligious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt\r\nneedles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even\r\neating.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by\r\nher, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why\r\nshould he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and\r\nmanners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted\r\nby preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly\r\ncharming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his\r\nattachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare\r\nmerit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the\r\nsmallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\r\nwife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who\r\ncould help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the\r\nproperty qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness\r\nalleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it\r\nconsisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In\r\nshort, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready\r\nto endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could\r\nalways put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should\r\never like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose\r\ncleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has\r\nalways the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\r\nof a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is\r\nof a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this\r\nestimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with\r\na little gum or starch in the form of tradition.\r\n\r\n“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,\r\nMiss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is\r\nthe most healthy of exercises.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia\r\ngood—if she would take to it.”\r\n\r\n“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily\r\nthrown.”\r\n\r\n“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a\r\nperfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”\r\n\r\n“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I\r\nought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond\r\nto your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and\r\nspoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,\r\nin amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is\r\nnot possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his\r\nmeasured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in\r\nthe utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep\r\nthe germinating grain away from the light.”\r\n\r\nDorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the\r\nspeaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,\r\nand with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could\r\nilluminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning\r\nalmost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!\r\n\r\nDorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have\r\ngone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,\r\nwhich has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.\r\nHas any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of\r\npre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to\r\ntell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons\r\nwould do her honor.”\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had\r\nlooked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom\r\nhe was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm\r\ntowards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a\r\nclergyman of some distinction.\r\n\r\nHowever, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with\r\nMr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to\r\nCelia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,\r\nand asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,\r\nCelia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the\r\nsecond Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,\r\nthough not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the\r\nelder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all\r\nrespects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to\r\nhaving the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who\r\npretended not to expect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n“Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,\r\nThe affable archangel . . .\r\n                    Eve\r\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled\r\nWith admiration, and deep muse, to hear\r\nOf things so high and strange.”\r\n—_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a\r\nsuitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him\r\nwere already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day\r\nthe reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long\r\nconversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company\r\nof Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to\r\nplay with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.\r\n\r\nDorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of\r\nMr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine\r\nextension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own\r\nexperience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great\r\nwork, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as\r\ninstructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the\r\narchangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what\r\nindeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,\r\njustice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.\r\nCasaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical\r\nfragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally\r\nrevealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm\r\nfooting there, the vast field of mythical constructions became\r\nintelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of\r\ncorrespondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no\r\nlight or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of\r\nvolumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous\r\nstill-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of\r\nHippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to\r\nDorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done\r\nto a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:\r\nit is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the\r\nEnglish with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in\r\nany case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his\r\nacquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,\r\nthat conne Latyn but lytille.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this\r\nconception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school\r\nliterature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile\r\ncomplete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who\r\nunited the glories of doctor and saint.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when\r\nDorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she\r\ncould speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially\r\non the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of\r\nbelief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self\r\nin communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed\r\nin the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.\r\nCasaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of\r\nhis own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise\r\nconformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a\r\nwhole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his\r\nfeelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little\r\npool!”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly\r\nthan other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,\r\nbut interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent\r\nnature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a\r\nsky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of\r\nknowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself\r\nmay have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning\r\nsometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way\r\noff the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and\r\nthen arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in\r\nher trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of\r\ninvitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own\r\ndocuments on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called\r\ninto the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up\r\nfirst one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and\r\nuncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a\r\n“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the\r\njournal of his youthful Continental travels.\r\n\r\n“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you\r\nare a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much\r\nstudy to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these\r\nthings—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for\r\nParnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about\r\nGreece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely\r\nalong the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in\r\nthe right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as\r\npossible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this\r\ndesultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and\r\nthat the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an\r\namiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance\r\naided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?\r\n\r\nCertainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on\r\ndrawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her\r\nhis face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before\r\nhe left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke\r\nalong the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the\r\ndisadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship\r\nwith which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils\r\nof maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful\r\nprecision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be\r\nattended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that\r\nhe should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or\r\npersonal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the\r\n2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of\r\nthat date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a\r\nvolume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not\r\nthe ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten\r\nwriting. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to\r\nbe falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the\r\neager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in\r\nexperience is an epoch.\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.\r\nCasaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from\r\nTipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along\r\nthe shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the\r\nbordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,\r\nthe Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in\r\ntheir walks. There had risen before her the girl’s vision of a possible\r\nfuture for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope, and\r\nshe wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.\r\nShe walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and\r\nher straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with\r\nconjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little\r\nbackward. She would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were\r\nomitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind\r\nso as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time\r\nwhen public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be\r\ndissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never\r\nsurpassed by any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of\r\nMiss Brooke’s asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic’s\r\nexpression in her bright full eyes, as she looked before her, not\r\nconsciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood, the\r\nsolemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between\r\nthe far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other.\r\n\r\nAll people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform\r\ntimes), would have thought her an interesting object if they had\r\nreferred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary\r\nimages of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been\r\nsufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all\r\nspontaneous trust ought to be. Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and\r\ndreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little\r\ndrama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into\r\nall costumes. Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the\r\ndisadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it\r\nnot only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a\r\nsweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional\r\nability, and above all, his perfect sincerity. But perhaps no persons\r\nthen living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had\r\na sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions\r\nabout marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm\r\nabout the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own\r\nfire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern\r\nof plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.\r\n\r\nIt had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make\r\nher his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her with a sort\r\nof reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would be almost as if\r\na winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his\r\nhand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed by the\r\nindefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze, over\r\nall her desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do,\r\nwhat ought she to do?—she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet\r\nwith an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied\r\nby a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a\r\ndiscursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she\r\nmight have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find\r\nher ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler\r\nclergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the\r\nprivate experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under\r\nthe New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own\r\nboudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less\r\nstrict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously\r\ninexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such\r\ncontentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious\r\ndisposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one\r\naspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually\r\nconsequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow\r\nteaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a\r\nlabyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no\r\nwhither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration\r\nand inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to\r\njustify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended\r\nadmission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as\r\nyet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her\r\nwas one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own\r\nignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide\r\nwho would take her along the grandest path.\r\n\r\n“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking\r\nquickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to\r\nstudy that I might help him the better in his great works. There would\r\nbe nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean\r\nthe greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn\r\nto see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And\r\nthen I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it\r\nwas possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England. I don’t feel\r\nsure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a\r\nmission to a people whose language I don’t know;—unless it were\r\nbuilding good cottages—there can be no doubt about that. Oh, I hope I\r\nshould be able to get the people well housed in Lowick! I will draw\r\nplenty of plans while I have time.”\r\n\r\nDorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous\r\nway in which she was reckoning on uncertain events, but she was spared\r\nany inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the\r\nappearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The\r\nwell-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no\r\ndoubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam. He discerned Dorothea,\r\njumped off his horse at once, and, having delivered it to his groom,\r\nadvanced towards her with something white on his arm, at which the two\r\nsetters were barking in an excited manner.\r\n\r\n“How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,” he said, raising his hat and\r\nshowing his sleekly waving blond hair. “It has hastened the pleasure I\r\nwas looking forward to.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,\r\nreally a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of\r\nmaking himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a prospective\r\nbrother-in-law may be an oppression if he will always be presupposing\r\ntoo good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you\r\ncontradict him. The thought that he had made the mistake of paying his\r\naddresses to herself could not take shape: all her mental activity was\r\nused up in persuasions of another kind. But he was positively obtrusive\r\nat this moment, and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her\r\nroused temper made her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with\r\nsome haughtiness.\r\n\r\nSir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying\r\nto himself, and thought he never saw Miss Brooke looking so handsome.\r\n\r\n“I have brought a little petitioner,” he said, “or rather, I have\r\nbrought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is\r\noffered.” He showed the white object under his arm, which was a tiny\r\nMaltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.\r\n\r\n“It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as\r\npets,” said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very moment\r\n(as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why?” said Sir James, as they walked forward.\r\n\r\n“I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.\r\nThey are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse\r\nthat gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the\r\nanimals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on\r\ntheir own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.\r\nThose creatures are parasitic.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad I know that you do not like them,” said good Sir James.\r\n“I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are fond of\r\nthese Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will you?”\r\n\r\nThe objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and\r\nexpressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had\r\nbetter not have been born. But she felt it necessary to explain.\r\n\r\n“You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she likes\r\nthese small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, which she was very fond\r\nof. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on it. I am\r\nrather short-sighted.”\r\n\r\n“You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is\r\nalways a good opinion.”\r\n\r\nWhat answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I envy you that,” Sir James said, as they continued\r\nwalking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Your power of forming an opinion. I can form an opinion of persons. I\r\nknow when I like people. But about other matters, do you know, I have\r\noften a difficulty in deciding. One hears very sensible things said on\r\nopposite sides.”\r\n\r\n“Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don’t always discriminate between\r\nsense and nonsense.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt that she was rather rude.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James. “But you seem to have the power of\r\ndiscrimination.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from\r\nignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am\r\nunable to see it.”\r\n\r\n“I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you know,\r\nLovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the\r\nworld of a plan for cottages—quite wonderful for a young lady, he\r\nthought. You had a real _genus_, to use his expression. He said you\r\nwanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he seemed to\r\nthink it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,\r\nthat is one of the things I wish to do—I mean, on my own estate. I\r\nshould be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me\r\nsee it. Of course, it is sinking money; that is why people object to\r\nit. Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer. But, after all, it\r\nis worth doing.”\r\n\r\n“Worth doing! yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting\r\nher previous small vexations. “I think we deserve to be beaten out of\r\nour beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords—all of us who let\r\ntenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might\r\nbe happier than ours, if they were real houses fit for human beings\r\nfrom whom we expect duties and affections.”\r\n\r\n“Will you show me your plan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been\r\nexamining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked out\r\nwhat seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the\r\npattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should\r\nput the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,\r\nbuilding model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being\r\nbuilt at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation—it would be\r\nas if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the\r\nlife of poverty beautiful!\r\n\r\nSir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with\r\nLovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was making great\r\nprogress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese puppy was not\r\noffered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with\r\nsurprise; but she blamed herself for it. She had been engrossing Sir\r\nJames. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nCelia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir\r\nJames’s illusion. “He thinks that Dodo cares about him, and she only\r\ncares about her plans. Yet I am not certain that she would refuse him\r\nif she thought he would let her manage everything and carry out all her\r\nnotions. And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear\r\nnotions.”\r\n\r\nIt was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She dared not\r\nconfess it to her sister in any direct statement, for that would be\r\nlaying herself open to a demonstration that she was somehow or other at\r\nwar with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she had an indirect\r\nmode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her\r\ndown from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring,\r\nnot listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait,\r\nand came from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When\r\npeople talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and\r\nfeatures merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons\r\nconsented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner\r\nrequisite for that vocal exercise.\r\n\r\nIt was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which\r\nhe was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.\r\nThus Dorothea had three more conversations with him, and was convinced\r\nthat her first impressions had been just. He was all she had at first\r\nimagined him to be: almost everything he had said seemed like a\r\nspecimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which\r\nmight open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his mental\r\nwealth was all the deeper and more effective on her inclination because\r\nit was now obvious that his visits were made for her sake. This\r\naccomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the\r\npains to talk to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to\r\nher understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What\r\ndelightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that\r\ntrivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy\r\nmen which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an\r\nodor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in, or else he\r\nwas silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable\r\ngenuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which\r\nuses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked as\r\nreverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she\r\ndid at his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of\r\ndevout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he allowed\r\nhimself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his\r\nyouth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she might reckon on\r\nunderstanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite\r\nthemes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about\r\nbuilding cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow\r\naccommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,\r\nDorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her\r\nmind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying\r\nconditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted\r\nwickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these arguments on Mr.\r\nCasaubon when he came again? But further reflection told her that she\r\nwas presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject; he would\r\nnot disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as\r\nother women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and\r\nembroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she\r\ndetected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited\r\nto go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose\r\nthat Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke’s society for its own sake,\r\neither with or without documents?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more in Sir\r\nJames Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He\r\ncame much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him\r\ndisagreeable since he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had\r\nalready entered with much practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates,\r\nand was charmingly docile. She proposed to build a couple of cottages,\r\nand transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be\r\npulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites. Sir\r\nJames said “Exactly,” and she bore the word remarkably well.\r\n\r\nCertainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very\r\nuseful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were\r\nfortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is difficult to say\r\nwhether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing\r\nblind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in\r\nrelation to her. But her life was just now full of hope and action: she\r\nwas not only thinking of her plans, but getting down learned books from\r\nthe library and reading many things hastily (that she might be a little\r\nless ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited\r\nwith conscientious questionings whether she were not exalting these\r\npoor doings above measure and contemplating them with that\r\nself-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.\r\n\r\n2_d Gent._ Ay, truly: but I think it is the world\r\nThat brings the iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish,” said Celia, as\r\nthey were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.\r\n\r\n“He is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, inconsiderately.\r\n\r\n“You mean that he appears silly.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her hand on\r\nher sister’s a moment, “but he does not talk equally well on all\r\nsubjects.”\r\n\r\n“I should think none but disagreeable people do,” said Celia, in her\r\nusual purring way. “They must be very dreadful to live with. Only\r\nthink! at breakfast, and always.”\r\n\r\nDorothea laughed. “O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!” She pinched\r\nCelia’s chin, being in the mood now to think her very winning and\r\nlovely—fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not\r\ndoctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a\r\nsquirrel. “Of course people need not be always talking well. Only one\r\ntells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that Sir James tries and fails.”\r\n\r\n“I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir James? It\r\nis not the object of his life to please me.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. He thinks of me as a future sister—that is all.” Dorothea\r\nhad never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such\r\nsubjects which was mutual between the sisters, until it should be\r\nintroduced by some decisive event. Celia blushed, but said at once—\r\n\r\n“Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp was\r\nbrushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man knew from\r\nMrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss\r\nBrooke.”\r\n\r\n“How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said\r\nDorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her\r\nmemory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation. “You must\r\nhave asked her questions. It is degrading.”\r\n\r\n“I see no harm at all in Tantripp’s talking to me. It is better to hear\r\nwhat people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions. I\r\nam quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer; and he\r\nbelieves that you will accept him, especially since you have been so\r\npleased with him about the plans. And uncle too—I know he expects it.\r\nEvery one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you.”\r\n\r\nThe revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea’s mind that the\r\ntears welled up and flowed abundantly. All her dear plans were\r\nembittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving that\r\nshe recognized him as her lover. There was vexation too on account of\r\nCelia.\r\n\r\n“How could he expect it?” she burst forth in her most impetuous manner.\r\n“I have never agreed with him about anything but the cottages: I was\r\nbarely polite to him before.”\r\n\r\n“But you have been so pleased with him since then; he has begun to feel\r\nquite sure that you are fond of him.”\r\n\r\n“Fond of him, Celia! How can you choose such odious expressions?” said\r\nDorothea, passionately.\r\n\r\n“Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a\r\nman whom you accepted for a husband.”\r\n\r\n“It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of\r\nhim. Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have\r\ntowards the man I would accept as a husband.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,\r\nbecause you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are,\r\nand treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody else sees;\r\nit is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.\r\nThat’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;\r\nand she was not sparing the sister of whom she was occasionally in awe.\r\nWho can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us\r\nbeings of wider speculation?\r\n\r\n“It is very painful,” said Dorothea, feeling scourged. “I can have no\r\nmore to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him. I must tell him\r\nI will have nothing to do with them. It is very painful.” Her eyes\r\nfilled again with tears.\r\n\r\n“Wait a little. Think about it. You know he is going away for a day or\r\ntwo to see his sister. There will be nobody besides Lovegood.” Celia\r\ncould not help relenting. “Poor Dodo,” she went on, in an amiable\r\nstaccato. “It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw plans.”\r\n\r\n“_Fad_ to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my\r\nfellow-creatures’ houses in that childish way? I may well make\r\nmistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among\r\npeople with such petty thoughts?”\r\n\r\nNo more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover her temper\r\nand behave so as to show that she admitted any error in herself. She\r\nwas disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the\r\npurblind conscience of the society around her: and Celia was no longer\r\nthe eternal cherub, but a thorn in her spirit, a pink-and-white\r\nnullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the “Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress.” The _fad_ of drawing plans! What was life worth—what great\r\nfaith was possible when the whole effect of one’s actions could be\r\nwithered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the\r\ncarriage, her cheeks were pale and her eyelids red. She was an image of\r\nsorrow, and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed,\r\nif Celia had not been close to her looking so pretty and composed, that\r\nhe at once concluded Dorothea’s tears to have their origin in her\r\nexcessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence, from a\r\njourney to the county town, about a petition for the pardon of some\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him, “I hope\r\nnothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.”\r\n\r\n“No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at the\r\ncottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.”\r\n\r\n“I came by Lowick to lunch—you didn’t know I came by Lowick. And I have\r\nbrought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea—in the library, you\r\nknow; they lie on the table in the library.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her\r\nfrom despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early\r\nChurch. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken\r\noff, and she walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.\r\nBrooke was detained by a message, but when he re-entered the library,\r\nhe found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which\r\nhad some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly\r\nas she might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry,\r\nhot, dreary walk.\r\n\r\nShe was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad\r\nliability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards the\r\nwood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice\r\nbetween the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very mildly\r\ntowards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he had\r\nnothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as soon as she\r\nwas aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to go. Usually she\r\nwould have been interested about her uncle’s merciful errand on behalf\r\nof the criminal, but her late agitation had made her absent-minded.\r\n\r\n“I came back by Lowick, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not as if with any\r\nintention to arrest her departure, but apparently from his usual\r\ntendency to say what he had said before. This fundamental principle of\r\nhuman speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I lunched there and\r\nsaw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing. There’s a sharp air,\r\ndriving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look cold.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times, when\r\nher uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to be\r\nexasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle and\r\nbonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up\r\nher beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small\r\nhands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be holding\r\nthem up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,\r\nwhich in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in\r\ncrying and red eyelids.\r\n\r\nShe bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news have\r\nyou brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”\r\n\r\n“What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to be\r\nhanged.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.\r\n\r\n“Hanged, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. “Poor Romilly!\r\nhe would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn’t know Romilly.\r\nHe is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is.”\r\n\r\n“When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he must of\r\ncourse give up seeing much of the world. How can he go about making\r\nacquaintances?”\r\n\r\n“That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a bachelor\r\ntoo, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my\r\nway to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never moped: but I\r\ncan see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants a companion—a companion,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a great honor to any one to be his companion,” said\r\nDorothea, energetically.\r\n\r\n“You like him, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, without showing any surprise, or\r\nother emotion. “Well, now, I’ve known Casaubon ten years, ever since he\r\ncame to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him—any ideas, you\r\nknow. However, he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop—that kind of\r\nthing, you know, if Peel stays in. And he has a very high opinion of\r\nyou, my dear.”\r\n\r\nDorothea could not speak.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, he has a very high opinion indeed of you. And he speaks\r\nuncommonly well—does Casaubon. He has deferred to me, you not being of\r\nage. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told him I\r\nthought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell him that. I\r\nsaid, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing. But I didn’t\r\nthink it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the\r\nshort of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of\r\nmarriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory\r\nnod. “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n\r\nNo one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner, but he\r\ndid really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that, if there\r\nwere any need for advice, he might give it in time. What feeling he, as\r\na magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was\r\nunmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he repeated,\r\n“I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. “I am\r\nvery grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I shall accept\r\nhim. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, “Ah?\r\n… Well! He is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is a good\r\nmatch. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere against your\r\nwishes, my dear. People should have their own way in marriage, and that\r\nsort of thing—up to a certain point, you know. I have always said that,\r\nup to a certain point. I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason\r\nto believe that Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said\r\nDorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.”\r\n\r\n“That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam\r\nwas just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said Dorothea,\r\nfeeling some of her late irritation revive.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject\r\nof study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect state of\r\nscientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like Chettam with\r\nno chance at all.\r\n\r\n“Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry—I mean for you. It’s true,\r\nevery year will tell upon him. He is over five-and-forty, you know. I\r\nshould say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To be sure,—if\r\nyou like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we can’t have\r\neverything. And his income is good—he has a handsome property\r\nindependent of the Church—his income is good. Still he is not young,\r\nand I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his health is\r\nnot over-strong. I know nothing else against him.”\r\n\r\n“I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,” said\r\nDorothea, with grave decision. “I should wish to have a husband who was\r\nabove me in judgment and in all knowledge.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke repeated his subdued, “Ah?—I thought you had more of your\r\nown opinion than most girls. I thought you liked your own opinion—liked\r\nit, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I should\r\nwish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see\r\nwhich opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live\r\naccording to them.”\r\n\r\n“Very true. You couldn’t put the thing better—couldn’t put it better,\r\nbeforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,” continued Mr.\r\nBrooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best he could for\r\nhis niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a mould—not cut out by\r\nrule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and it\r\nwill be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved any\r\none well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a noose,\r\nyou know. Temper, now. There is temper. And a husband likes to be\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n“I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of higher\r\nduties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,” said poor\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,\r\nthat kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon’s ways might suit you\r\nbetter than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would\r\nnot hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how\r\nanything may turn out. You have not the same tastes as every young\r\nlady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a bishop—that kind of\r\nthing—may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam is a good fellow, a\r\ngood sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he doesn’t go much into ideas.\r\nI did, when I was his age. But Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has\r\nhurt them a little with too much reading.”\r\n\r\n“I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for me to\r\nhelp him,” said Dorothea, ardently.\r\n\r\n“You have quite made up your mind, I see. Well, my dear, the fact is, I\r\nhave a letter for you in my pocket.” Mr. Brooke handed the letter to\r\nDorothea, but as she rose to go away, he added, “There is not too much\r\nhurry, my dear. Think about it, you know.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly spoken\r\nstrongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a striking\r\nmanner. It was his duty to do so. But as to pretending to be wise for\r\nyoung people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled in his youth,\r\nabsorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could\r\npretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young\r\ngirl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam. In short, woman was a problem\r\nwhich, since Mr. Brooke’s mind felt blank before it, could be hardly\r\nless complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n“Hard students are commonly troubled with gowts, catarrhs, rheums,\r\ncachexia, bradypepsia, bad eyes, stone, and collick, crudities,\r\noppilations, vertigo, winds, consumptions, and all such diseases as\r\ncome by over-much sitting: they are most part lean, dry, ill-colored …\r\nand all through immoderate pains and extraordinary studies. If you will\r\nnot believe the truth of this, look upon great Tostatus and Thomas\r\nAquainas’ works; and tell me whether those men took pains.”—BURTON’S\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_, P. I, s. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Casaubon’s letter.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MISS BROOKE,—I have your guardian’s permission to address you\r\non a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust,\r\nmistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of\r\ndate in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen\r\ncontemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with\r\nyou. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your\r\neminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I\r\nmay say, with such activity of the affections as even the\r\npreoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not\r\nuninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for\r\nobservation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me\r\nmore emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus\r\nevoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now\r\nreferred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to\r\nyou the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to\r\nthe commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation\r\nof thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not\r\nconceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with\r\nthose graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer\r\ndistinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental\r\nqualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet\r\nwith this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive,\r\nadapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant\r\nhours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me\r\nagain say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with\r\nforeshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages\r\ntowards the completion of a life’s plan), I should presumably have gone\r\non to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a\r\nmatrimonial union.\r\n    Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my\r\n    feelings; and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to\r\n    ask you how far your own are of a nature to confirm my happy\r\n    presentiment. To be accepted by you as your husband and the earthly\r\n    guardian of your welfare, I should regard as the highest of\r\n    providential gifts. In return I can at least offer you an affection\r\n    hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which,\r\n    however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you\r\n    choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly\r\n    cause you either bitterness or shame. I await the expression of\r\n    your sentiments with an anxiety which it would be the part of\r\n    wisdom (were it possible) to divert by a more arduous labor than\r\n    usual. But in this order of experience I am still young, and in\r\n    looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel\r\n    that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the\r\n    temporary illumination of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, I shall remain,\r\n    Yours with sincere devotion,\r\n        EDWARD CASAUBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea trembled while she read this letter; then she fell on her\r\nknees, buried her face, and sobbed. She could not pray: under the rush\r\nof solemn emotion in which thoughts became vague and images floated\r\nuncertainly, she could but cast herself, with a childlike sense of\r\nreclining, in the lap of a divine consciousness which sustained her\r\nown. She remained in that attitude till it was time to dress for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nHow could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it\r\ncritically as a profession of love? Her whole soul was possessed by the\r\nfact that a fuller life was opening before her: she was a neophyte\r\nabout to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She was going to have\r\nroom for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and\r\npressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the\r\nworld’s habits.\r\n\r\nNow she would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties;\r\nnow she would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind\r\nthat she could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of\r\nproud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man\r\nwhom her admiration had chosen. All Dorothea’s passion was transfused\r\nthrough a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the radiance of her\r\ntransfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its\r\nlevel. The impetus with which inclination became resolution was\r\nheightened by those little events of the day which had roused her\r\ndiscontent with the actual conditions of her life.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when Celia was playing an “air, with variations,” a small\r\nkind of tinkling which symbolized the aesthetic part of the young\r\nladies’ education, Dorothea went up to her room to answer Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s letter. Why should she defer the answer? She wrote it over\r\nthree times, not because she wished to change the wording, but because\r\nher hand was unusually uncertain, and she could not bear that Mr.\r\nCasaubon should think her handwriting bad and illegible. She piqued\r\nherself on writing a hand in which each letter was distinguishable\r\nwithout any large range of conjecture, and she meant to make much use\r\nof this accomplishment, to save Mr. Casaubon’s eyes. Three times she\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I am very grateful to you for loving me, and\r\nthinking me worthy to be your wife. I can look forward to no better\r\nhappiness than that which would be one with yours. If I said more, it\r\nwould only be the same thing written out at greater length, for I\r\ncannot now dwell on any other thought than that I may be through life\r\n\r\n\r\nYours devotedly,\r\n    DOROTHEA BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in the evening she followed her uncle into the library to give\r\nhim the letter, that he might send it in the morning. He was surprised,\r\nbut his surprise only issued in a few moments’ silence, during which he\r\npushed about various objects on his writing-table, and finally stood\r\nwith his back to the fire, his glasses on his nose, looking at the\r\naddress of Dorothea’s letter.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought enough about this, my dear?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“There was no need to think long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me\r\nvacillate. If I changed my mind, it must be because of something\r\nimportant and entirely new to me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—then you have accepted him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has\r\nChettam offended you—offended you, you know? What is it you don’t like\r\nin Chettam?”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing that I like in him,” said Dorothea, rather\r\nimpetuously.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke threw his head and shoulders backward as if some one had\r\nthrown a light missile at him. Dorothea immediately felt some\r\nself-rebuke, and said—\r\n\r\n“I mean in the light of a husband. He is very kind, I think—really very\r\ngood about the cottages. A well-meaning man.”\r\n\r\n“But you must have a scholar, and that sort of thing? Well, it lies a\r\nlittle in our family. I had it myself—that love of knowledge, and going\r\ninto everything—a little too much—it took me too far; though that sort\r\nof thing doesn’t often run in the female-line; or it runs underground\r\nlike the rivers in Greece, you know—it comes out in the sons. Clever\r\nsons, clever mothers. I went a good deal into that, at one time.\r\nHowever, my dear, I have always said that people should do as they like\r\nin these things, up to a certain point. I couldn’t, as your guardian,\r\nhave consented to a bad match. But Casaubon stands well: his position\r\nis good. I am afraid Chettam will be hurt, though, and Mrs. Cadwallader\r\nwill blame me.”\r\n\r\nThat evening, of course, Celia knew nothing of what had happened. She\r\nattributed Dorothea’s abstracted manner, and the evidence of further\r\ncrying since they had got home, to the temper she had been in about Sir\r\nJames Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further\r\noffence: having once said what she wanted to say, Celia had no\r\ndisposition to recur to disagreeable subjects. It had been her nature\r\nwhen a child never to quarrel with any one—only to observe with wonder\r\nthat they quarrelled with her, and looked like turkey-cocks; whereupon\r\nshe was ready to play at cat’s cradle with them whenever they recovered\r\nthemselves. And as to Dorothea, it had always been her way to find\r\nsomething wrong in her sister’s words, though Celia inwardly protested\r\nthat she always said just how things were, and nothing else: she never\r\ndid and never could put words together out of her own head. But the\r\nbest of Dodo was, that she did not keep angry for long together. Now,\r\nthough they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when\r\nCelia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which\r\nshe was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low\r\nstool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the\r\nmusical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her\r\nspeech like a fine bit of recitative—\r\n\r\n“Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.\r\n\r\nCelia knelt down to get the right level and gave her little butterfly\r\nkiss, while Dorothea encircled her with gentle arms and pressed her\r\nlips gravely on each cheek in turn.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sit up, Dodo, you are so pale to-night: go to bed soon,” said\r\nCelia, in a comfortable way, without any touch of pathos.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, I am very, very happy,” said Dorothea, fervently.\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” thought Celia. “But how strangely Dodo goes from\r\none extreme to the other.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, at luncheon, the butler, handing something to Mr. Brooke,\r\nsaid, “Jonas is come back, sir, and has brought this letter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke read the letter, and then, nodding toward Dorothea, said,\r\n“Casaubon, my dear: he will be here to dinner; he didn’t wait to write\r\nmore—didn’t wait, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt could not seem remarkable to Celia that a dinner guest should be\r\nannounced to her sister beforehand, but, her eyes following the same\r\ndirection as her uncle’s, she was struck with the peculiar effect of\r\nthe announcement on Dorothea. It seemed as if something like the\r\nreflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features,\r\nending in one of her rare blushes. For the first time it entered into\r\nCelia’s mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon\r\nand her sister than his delight in bookish talk and her delight in\r\nlistening. Hitherto she had classed the admiration for this “ugly” and\r\nlearned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at\r\nLausanne, also ugly and learned. Dorothea had never been tired of\r\nlistening to old Monsieur Liret when Celia’s feet were as cold as\r\npossible, and when it had really become dreadful to see the skin of his\r\nbald head moving about. Why then should her enthusiasm not extend to\r\nMr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret? And it seemed\r\nprobable that all learned men had a sort of schoolmaster’s view of\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\nBut now Celia was really startled at the suspicion which had darted\r\ninto her mind. She was seldom taken by surprise in this way, her\r\nmarvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally\r\npreparing her to expect such outward events as she had an interest in.\r\nNot that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover:\r\nshe had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in\r\nDorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue. Here was something\r\nreally to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir\r\nJames Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a sort\r\nof shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo, if\r\nshe were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned away\r\nfrom it: experience had often shown that her impressibility might be\r\ncalculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out,\r\nso they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed\r\nthat Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent\r\ninterest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book\r\nand looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.\r\nShe herself had taken up the making of a toy for the curate’s children,\r\nand was not going to enter on any subject too precipitately.\r\n\r\nDorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know\r\nof the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon’s position since he had last\r\nbeen in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of\r\nwhat would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was\r\nimpossible not to shrink from telling her. Dorothea accused herself of\r\nsome meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any\r\nsmall fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she\r\nwas seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the\r\ncorrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose. Her reverie was\r\nbroken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia’s small and\r\nrather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or\r\na “by the bye.”\r\n\r\n“Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“I hope there is some one else. Then I shall not hear him eat his soup\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“What is there remarkable about his soup-eating?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Dodo, can’t you hear how he scrapes his spoon? And he always\r\nblinks before he speaks. I don’t know whether Locke blinked, but I’m\r\nsure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him if he did.”\r\n\r\n“Celia,” said Dorothea, with emphatic gravity, “pray don’t make any\r\nmore observations of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? They are quite true,” returned Celia, who had her reasons for\r\npersevering, though she was beginning to be a little afraid.\r\n\r\n“Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful. I think it is\r\na pity Mr. Casaubon’s mother had not a commoner mind: she might have\r\ntaught him better.” Celia was inwardly frightened, and ready to run\r\naway, now she had hurled this light javelin.\r\n\r\nDorothea’s feelings had gathered to an avalanche, and there could be no\r\nfurther preparation.\r\n\r\n“It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr.\r\nCasaubon.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Celia had never turned so pale before. The paper man she was\r\nmaking would have had his leg injured, but for her habitual care of\r\nwhatever she held in her hands. She laid the fragile figure down at\r\nonce, and sat perfectly still for a few moments. When she spoke there\r\nwas a tear gathering.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.” Her sisterly tenderness could not\r\nbut surmount other feelings at this moment, and her fears were the\r\nfears of affection.\r\n\r\nDorothea was still hurt and agitated.\r\n\r\n“It is quite decided, then?” said Celia, in an awed under tone. “And\r\nuncle knows?”\r\n\r\n“I have accepted Mr. Casaubon’s offer. My uncle brought me the letter\r\nthat contained it; he knew about it beforehand.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,” said\r\nCelia, with a slight sob. She never could have thought that she should\r\nfeel as she did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and\r\nMr. Casaubon seemed to be the officiating clergyman, about whom it\r\nwould be indecent to make remarks.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Kitty, do not grieve. We should never admire the same\r\npeople. I often offend in something of the same way; I am apt to speak\r\ntoo strongly of those who don’t please me.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as\r\nmuch from Celia’s subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of\r\ncourse all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this\r\nmarriage. Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she did about life and\r\nits best objects.\r\n\r\nNevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy. In an\r\nhour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mr. Casaubon she talked to him with more\r\nfreedom than she had ever felt before, even pouring out her joy at the\r\nthought of devoting herself to him, and of learning how she might best\r\nshare and further all his great ends. Mr. Casaubon was touched with an\r\nunknown delight (what man would not have been?) at this childlike\r\nunrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?)\r\nthat he should be the object of it.\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady—Miss Brooke—Dorothea!” he said, pressing her hand\r\nbetween his hands, “this is a happiness greater than I had ever\r\nimagined to be in reserve for me. That I should ever meet with a mind\r\nand person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage\r\ndesirable, was far indeed from my conception. You have all—nay, more\r\nthan all—those qualities which I have ever regarded as the\r\ncharacteristic excellences of womanhood. The great charm of your sex is\r\nits capability of an ardent self-sacrificing affection, and herein we\r\nsee its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own.\r\nHitherto I have known few pleasures save of the severer kind: my\r\nsatisfactions have been those of the solitary student. I have been\r\nlittle disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand, but now\r\nI shall pluck them with eagerness, to place them in your bosom.”\r\n\r\nNo speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the\r\nfrigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the\r\ncawing of an amorous rook. Would it not be rash to conclude that there\r\nwas no passion behind those sonnets to Delia which strike us as the\r\nthin music of a mandolin?\r\n\r\nDorothea’s faith supplied all that Mr. Casaubon’s words seemed to leave\r\nunsaid: what believer sees a disturbing omission or infelicity? The\r\ntext, whether of prophet or of poet, expands for whatever we can put\r\ninto it, and even his bad grammar is sublime.\r\n\r\n“I am very ignorant—you will quite wonder at my ignorance,” said\r\nDorothea. “I have so many thoughts that may be quite mistaken; and now\r\nI shall be able to tell them all to you, and ask you about them. But,”\r\nshe added, with rapid imagination of Mr. Casaubon’s probable feeling,\r\n“I will not trouble you too much; only when you are inclined to listen\r\nto me. You must often be weary with the pursuit of subjects in your own\r\ntrack. I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there.”\r\n\r\n“How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your\r\ncompanionship?” said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her candid brow, and feeling\r\nthat heaven had vouchsafed him a blessing in every way suited to his\r\npeculiar wants. He was being unconsciously wrought upon by the charms\r\nof a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for\r\nimmediate effects or for remoter ends. It was this which made Dorothea\r\nso childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her\r\nreputed cleverness; as, for example, in the present case of throwing\r\nherself, metaphorically speaking, at Mr. Casaubon’s feet, and kissing\r\nhis unfashionable shoe-ties as if he were a Protestant Pope. She was\r\nnot in the least teaching Mr. Casaubon to ask if he were good enough\r\nfor her, but merely asking herself anxiously how she could be good\r\nenough for Mr. Casaubon. Before he left the next day it had been\r\ndecided that the marriage should take place within six weeks. Why not?\r\nMr. Casaubon’s house was ready. It was not a parsonage, but a\r\nconsiderable mansion, with much land attached to it. The parsonage was\r\ninhabited by the curate, who did all the duty except preaching the\r\nmorning sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMy lady’s tongue is like the meadow blades,\r\nThat cut you stroking them with idle hand.\r\nNice cutting is her function: she divides\r\nWith spiritual edge the millet-seed,\r\nAnd makes intangible savings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Casaubon’s carriage was passing out of the gateway, it arrested\r\nthe entrance of a pony phaeton driven by a lady with a servant seated\r\nbehind. It was doubtful whether the recognition had been mutual, for\r\nMr. Casaubon was looking absently before him; but the lady was\r\nquick-eyed, and threw a nod and a “How do you do?” in the nick of time.\r\nIn spite of her shabby bonnet and very old Indian shawl, it was plain\r\nthat the lodge-keeper regarded her as an important personage, from the\r\nlow curtsy which was dropped on the entrance of the small phaeton.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Fitchett, how are your fowls laying now?” said the\r\nhigh-colored, dark-eyed lady, with the clearest chiselled utterance.\r\n\r\n“Pretty well for laying, madam, but they’ve ta’en to eating their eggs:\r\nI’ve no peace o’ mind with ’em at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the cannibals! Better sell them cheap at once. What will you sell\r\nthem a couple? One can’t eat fowls of a bad character at a high price.”\r\n\r\n“Well, madam, half-a-crown: I couldn’t let ’em go, not under.”\r\n\r\n“Half-a-crown, these times! Come now—for the Rector’s chicken-broth on\r\na Sunday. He has consumed all ours that I can spare. You are half paid\r\nwith the sermon, Mrs. Fitchett, remember that. Take a pair of\r\ntumbler-pigeons for them—little beauties. You must come and see them.\r\nYou have no tumblers among your pigeons.”\r\n\r\n“Well, madam, Master Fitchett shall go and see ’em after work. He’s\r\nvery hot on new sorts; to oblige you.”\r\n\r\n“Oblige me! It will be the best bargain he ever made. A pair of church\r\npigeons for a couple of wicked Spanish fowls that eat their own eggs!\r\nDon’t you and Fitchett boast too much, that is all!”\r\n\r\nThe phaeton was driven onwards with the last words, leaving Mrs.\r\nFitchett laughing and shaking her head slowly, with an interjectional\r\n“Sure_ly_, sure_ly_!”—from which it might be inferred that she would\r\nhave found the country-side somewhat duller if the Rector’s lady had\r\nbeen less free-spoken and less of a skinflint. Indeed, both the farmers\r\nand laborers in the parishes of Freshitt and Tipton would have felt a\r\nsad lack of conversation but for the stories about what Mrs.\r\nCadwallader said and did: a lady of immeasurably high birth, descended,\r\nas it were, from unknown earls, dim as the crowd of heroic shades—who\r\npleaded poverty, pared down prices, and cut jokes in the most\r\ncompanionable manner, though with a turn of tongue that let you know\r\nwho she was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and\r\nreligion, and mitigated the bitterness of uncommuted tithe. A much more\r\nexemplary character with an infusion of sour dignity would not have\r\nfurthered their comprehension of the Thirty-nine Articles, and would\r\nhave been less socially uniting.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke, seeing Mrs. Cadwallader’s merits from a different point of\r\nview, winced a little when her name was announced in the library, where\r\nhe was sitting alone.\r\n\r\n“I see you have had our Lowick Cicero here,” she said, seating herself\r\ncomfortably, throwing back her wraps, and showing a thin but well-built\r\nfigure. “I suspect you and he are brewing some bad polities, else you\r\nwould not be seeing so much of the lively man. I shall inform against\r\nyou: remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel’s\r\nside about the Catholic Bill. I shall tell everybody that you are going\r\nto put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton resigns,\r\nand that Casaubon is going to help you in an underhand manner: going to\r\nbribe the voters with pamphlets, and throw open the public-houses to\r\ndistribute them. Come, confess!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort,” said Mr. Brooke, smiling and rubbing his\r\neye-glasses, but really blushing a little at the impeachment. “Casaubon\r\nand I don’t talk politics much. He doesn’t care much about the\r\nphilanthropic side of things; punishments, and that kind of thing. He\r\nonly cares about Church questions. That is not my line of action, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Ra-a-ther too much, my friend. I have heard of your doings. Who was it\r\nthat sold his bit of land to the Papists at Middlemarch? I believe you\r\nbought it on purpose. You are a perfect Guy Faux. See if you are not\r\nburnt in effigy this 5th of November coming. Humphrey would not come to\r\nquarrel with you about it, so I am come.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. I was prepared to be persecuted for not persecuting—not\r\npersecuting, you know.”\r\n\r\n“There you go! That is a piece of clap-trap you have got ready for the\r\nhustings. Now, _do not_ let them lure you to the hustings, my dear Mr.\r\nBrooke. A man always makes a fool of himself, speechifying: there’s no\r\nexcuse but being on the right side, so that you can ask a blessing on\r\nyour humming and hawing. You will lose yourself, I forewarn you. You\r\nwill make a Saturday pie of all parties’ opinions, and be pelted by\r\neverybody.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I expect, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not wishing to\r\nbetray how little he enjoyed this prophetic sketch—“what I expect as an\r\nindependent man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers is\r\nnot likely to be hooked on by any party. He may go with them up to a\r\ncertain point—up to a certain point, you know. But that is what you\r\nladies never understand.”\r\n\r\n“Where your certain point is? No. I should like to be told how a man\r\ncan have any certain point when he belongs to no party—leading a roving\r\nlife, and never letting his friends know his address. ‘Nobody knows\r\nwhere Brooke will be—there’s no counting on Brooke’—that is what people\r\nsay of you, to be quite frank. Now, do turn respectable. How will you\r\nlike going to Sessions with everybody looking shy on you, and you with\r\na bad conscience and an empty pocket?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t pretend to argue with a lady on politics,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nwith an air of smiling indifference, but feeling rather unpleasantly\r\nconscious that this attack of Mrs. Cadwallader’s had opened the\r\ndefensive campaign to which certain rash steps had exposed him. “Your\r\nsex are not thinkers, you know—_varium et mutabile semper_—that kind of\r\nthing. You don’t know Virgil. I knew”—Mr. Brooke reflected in time that\r\nhe had not had the personal acquaintance of the Augustan poet—“I was\r\ngoing to say, poor Stoddart, you know. That was what _he_ said. You\r\nladies are always against an independent attitude—a man’s caring for\r\nnothing but truth, and that sort of thing. And there is no part of the\r\ncounty where opinion is narrower than it is here—I don’t mean to throw\r\nstones, you know, but somebody is wanted to take the independent line;\r\nand if I don’t take it, who will?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Why, any upstart who has got neither blood nor position. People\r\nof standing should consume their independent nonsense at home, not hawk\r\nit about. And you! who are going to marry your niece, as good as your\r\ndaughter, to one of our best men. Sir James would be cruelly annoyed:\r\nit will be too hard on him if you turn round now and make yourself a\r\nWhig sign-board.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke again winced inwardly, for Dorothea’s engagement had no\r\nsooner been decided, than he had thought of Mrs. Cadwallader’s\r\nprospective taunts. It might have been easy for ignorant observers to\r\nsay, “Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader;” but where is a country gentleman\r\nto go who quarrels with his oldest neighbors? Who could taste the fine\r\nflavor in the name of Brooke if it were delivered casually, like wine\r\nwithout a seal? Certainly a man can only be cosmopolitan up to a\r\ncertain point.\r\n\r\n“I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to\r\nsay there is no prospect of his marrying my niece,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nmuch relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharp note of surprise. “It is\r\nhardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it.”\r\n\r\n“My niece has chosen another suitor—has chosen him, you know. I have\r\nhad nothing to do with it. I should have preferred Chettam; and I\r\nshould have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen. But\r\nthere is no accounting for these things. Your sex is capricious, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?”\r\nMrs. Cadwallader’s mind was rapidly surveying the possibilities of\r\nchoice for Dorothea.\r\n\r\nBut here Celia entered, blooming from a walk in the garden, and the\r\ngreeting with her delivered Mr. Brooke from the necessity of answering\r\nimmediately. He got up hastily, and saying, “By the way, I must speak\r\nto Wright about the horses,” shuffled quickly out of the room.\r\n\r\n“My dear child, what is this?—this about your sister’s engagement?”\r\nsaid Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n\r\n“She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,” said Celia, resorting, as\r\nusual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity\r\nof speaking to the Rector’s wife alone.\r\n\r\n“This is frightful. How long has it been going on?”\r\n\r\n“I only knew of it yesterday. They are to be married in six weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, I wish you joy of your brother-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry for Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry! It is her doing, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; she says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don’t think it can be nice to marry a man with\r\na great soul.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, take warning. You know the look of one now; when the\r\nnext comes and wants to marry you, don’t you accept him.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I never should.”\r\n\r\n“No; one such in a family is enough. So your sister never cared about\r\nSir James Chettam? What would you have said to _him_ for a\r\nbrother-in-law?”\r\n\r\n“I should have liked that very much. I am sure he would have been a\r\ngood husband. Only,” Celia added, with a slight blush (she sometimes\r\nseemed to blush as she breathed), “I don’t think he would have suited\r\nDorothea.”\r\n\r\n“Not high-flown enough?”\r\n\r\n“Dodo is very strict. She thinks so much about everything, and is so\r\nparticular about what one says. Sir James never seemed to please her.”\r\n\r\n“She must have encouraged him, I am sure. That is not very creditable.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t be angry with Dodo; she does not see things. She thought\r\nso much about the cottages, and she was rude to Sir James sometimes;\r\nbut he is so kind, he never noticed it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, putting on her shawl, and rising, as if\r\nin haste, “I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him. He\r\nwill have brought his mother back by this time, and I must call. Your\r\nuncle will never tell him. We are all disappointed, my dear. Young\r\npeople should think of their families in marrying. I set a bad\r\nexample—married a poor clergyman, and made myself a pitiable object\r\namong the De Bracys—obliged to get my coals by stratagem, and pray to\r\nheaven for my salad oil. However, Casaubon has money enough; I must do\r\nhim that justice. As to his blood, I suppose the family quarterings are\r\nthree cuttle-fish sable, and a commentator rampant. By the bye, before\r\nI go, my dear, I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry. I want to\r\nsend my young cook to learn of her. Poor people with four children,\r\nlike us, you know, can’t afford to keep a good cook. I have no doubt\r\nMrs. Carter will oblige me. Sir James’s cook is a perfect dragon.”\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour, Mrs. Cadwallader had circumvented Mrs. Carter and\r\ndriven to Freshitt Hall, which was not far from her own parsonage, her\r\nhusband being resident in Freshitt and keeping a curate in Tipton.\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam had returned from the short journey which had kept\r\nhim absent for a couple of days, and had changed his dress, intending\r\nto ride over to Tipton Grange. His horse was standing at the door when\r\nMrs. Cadwallader drove up, and he immediately appeared there himself,\r\nwhip in hand. Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs. Cadwallader’s\r\nerrand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms, so she asked\r\nto be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the new plants;\r\nand on coming to a contemplative stand, she said—\r\n\r\n“I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love\r\nas you pretended to be.”\r\n\r\nIt was of no use protesting against Mrs. Cadwallader’s way of putting\r\nthings. But Sir James’s countenance changed a little. He felt a vague\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n“I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all. I accused\r\nhim of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side, and he\r\nlooked silly and never denied it—talked about the independent line, and\r\nthe usual nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” said Sir James, much relieved.\r\n\r\n“Why,” rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharper note, “you don’t mean\r\nto say that you would like him to turn public man in that way—making a\r\nsort of political Cheap Jack of himself?”\r\n\r\n“He might be dissuaded, I should think. He would not like the expense.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I told him. He is vulnerable to reason there—always a few\r\ngrains of common-sense in an ounce of miserliness. Miserliness is a\r\ncapital quality to run in families; it’s the safe side for madness to\r\ndip on. And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we\r\nshould not see what we are to see.”\r\n\r\n“What? Brooke standing for Middlemarch?”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that. I really feel a little responsible. I always told you\r\nMiss Brooke would be such a fine match. I knew there was a great deal\r\nof nonsense in her—a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But these\r\nthings wear out of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for once.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Mrs. Cadwallader?” said Sir James. His fear lest\r\nMiss Brooke should have run away to join the Moravian Brethren, or some\r\npreposterous sect unknown to good society, was a little allayed by the\r\nknowledge that Mrs. Cadwallader always made the worst of things. “What\r\nhas happened to Miss Brooke? Pray speak out.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. She is engaged to be married.” Mrs. Cadwallader paused a\r\nfew moments, observing the deeply hurt expression in her friend’s face,\r\nwhich he was trying to conceal by a nervous smile, while he whipped his\r\nboot; but she soon added, “Engaged to Casaubon.”\r\n\r\nSir James let his whip fall and stooped to pick it up. Perhaps his face\r\nhad never before gathered so much concentrated disgust as when he\r\nturned to Mrs. Cadwallader and repeated, “Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Even so. You know my errand now.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! It is horrible! He is no better than a mummy!” (The point of\r\nview has to be allowed for, as that of a blooming and disappointed\r\nrival.)\r\n\r\n“She says, he is a great soul.—A great bladder for dried peas to rattle\r\nin!” said Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n\r\n“What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?” said Sir James.\r\n“He has one foot in the grave.”\r\n\r\n“He means to draw it out again, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Brooke ought not to allow it: he should insist on its being put off\r\ntill she is of age. She would think better of it then. What is a\r\nguardian for?”\r\n\r\n“As if you could ever squeeze a resolution out of Brooke!”\r\n\r\n“Cadwallader might talk to him.”\r\n\r\n“Not he! Humphrey finds everybody charming. I never can get him to\r\nabuse Casaubon. He will even speak well of the bishop, though I tell\r\nhim it is unnatural in a beneficed clergyman; what can one do with a\r\nhusband who attends so little to the decencies? I hide it as well as I\r\ncan by abusing everybody myself. Come, come, cheer up! you are well rid\r\nof Miss Brooke, a girl who would have been requiring you to see the\r\nstars by daylight. Between ourselves, little Celia is worth two of her,\r\nand likely after all to be the better match. For this marriage to\r\nCasaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, on my own account—it is for Miss Brooke’s sake I think her friends\r\nshould try to use their influence.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Humphrey doesn’t know yet. But when I tell him, you may depend\r\non it he will say, ‘Why not? Casaubon is a good fellow—and young—young\r\nenough.’ These charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they\r\nhave swallowed it and got the colic. However, if I were a man I should\r\nprefer Celia, especially when Dorothea was gone. The truth is, you have\r\nbeen courting one and have won the other. I can see that she admires\r\nyou almost as much as a man expects to be admired. If it were any one\r\nbut me who said so, you might think it exaggeration. Good-by!”\r\n\r\nSir James handed Mrs. Cadwallader to the phaeton, and then jumped on\r\nhis horse. He was not going to renounce his ride because of his\r\nfriend’s unpleasant news—only to ride the faster in some other\r\ndirection than that of Tipton Grange.\r\n\r\nNow, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about\r\nMiss Brooke’s marriage; and why, when one match that she liked to think\r\nshe had a hand in was frustrated, should she have straightway contrived\r\nthe preliminaries of another? Was there any ingenious plot, any\r\nhide-and-seek course of action, which might be detected by a careful\r\ntelescopic watch? Not at all: a telescope might have swept the parishes\r\nof Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in\r\nher phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could excite\r\nsuspicion, or any scene from which she did not return with the same\r\nunperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color. In fact,\r\nif that convenient vehicle had existed in the days of the Seven Sages,\r\none of them would doubtless have remarked, that you can know little of\r\nwomen by following them about in their pony-phaetons. Even with a\r\nmicroscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making\r\ninterpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a\r\nweak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity\r\ninto which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so\r\nmany animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain\r\ntiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the\r\nswallower waits passively at his receipt of custom. In this way,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to Mrs. Cadwallader’s\r\nmatch-making will show a play of minute causes producing what may be\r\ncalled thought and speech vortices to bring her the sort of food she\r\nneeded. Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either\r\nfoul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected\r\nby the great affairs of the world. All the more did the affairs of the\r\ngreat world interest her, when communicated in the letters of high-born\r\nrelations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the\r\ndogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young\r\nLord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the\r\nexact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new\r\nbranch and widened the relations of scandal,—these were topics of which\r\nshe retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced them in\r\nan excellent pickle of epigrams, which she herself enjoyed the more\r\nbecause she believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as she did\r\nin game and vermin. She would never have disowned any one on the ground\r\nof poverty: a De Bracy reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have\r\nseemed to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I fear his\r\naristocratic vices would not have horrified her. But her feeling\r\ntowards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred: they had\r\nprobably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs.\r\nCadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in\r\nkind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God’s design in making\r\nthe world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. A town where\r\nsuch monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy, which\r\ncould not be taken account of in a well-bred scheme of the universe.\r\nLet any lady who is inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader inquire\r\ninto the comprehensiveness of her own beautiful views, and be quite\r\nsure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have the\r\nhonor to coexist with hers.\r\n\r\nWith such a mind, active as phosphorus, biting everything that came\r\nnear into the form that suited it, how could Mrs. Cadwallader feel that\r\nthe Miss Brookes and their matrimonial prospects were alien to her?\r\nespecially as it had been the habit of years for her to scold Mr.\r\nBrooke with the friendliest frankness, and let him know in confidence\r\nthat she thought him a poor creature. From the first arrival of the\r\nyoung ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir\r\nJames, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was\r\nher doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it,\r\ncaused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with. She\r\nwas the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen\r\nin spite of her was an offensive irregularity. As to freaks like this\r\nof Miss Brooke’s, Mrs. Cadwallader had no patience with them, and now\r\nsaw that her opinion of this girl had been infected with some of her\r\nhusband’s weak charitableness: those Methodistical whims, that air of\r\nbeing more religious than the rector and curate together, came from a\r\ndeeper and more constitutional disease than she had been willing to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n“However,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to\r\nher husband, “I throw her over: there was a chance, if she had married\r\nSir James, of her becoming a sane, sensible woman. He would never have\r\ncontradicted her, and when a woman is not contradicted, she has no\r\nmotive for obstinacy in her absurdities. But now I wish her joy of her\r\nhair shirt.”\r\n\r\nIt followed that Mrs. Cadwallader must decide on another match for Sir\r\nJames, and having made up her mind that it was to be the younger Miss\r\nBrooke, there could not have been a more skilful move towards the\r\nsuccess of her plan than her hint to the baronet that he had made an\r\nimpression on Celia’s heart. For he was not one of those gentlemen who\r\nlanguish after the unattainable Sappho’s apple that laughs from the\r\ntopmost bough—the charms which\r\n\r\n“Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff,\r\nNot to be come at by the willing hand.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had no sonnets to write, and it could not strike him agreeably that\r\nhe was not an object of preference to the woman whom he had preferred.\r\nAlready the knowledge that Dorothea had chosen Mr. Casaubon had bruised\r\nhis attachment and relaxed its hold. Although Sir James was a\r\nsportsman, he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse\r\nand foxes, and did not regard his future wife in the light of prey,\r\nvaluable chiefly for the excitements of the chase. Neither was he so\r\nwell acquainted with the habits of primitive races as to feel that an\r\nideal combat for her, tomahawk in hand, so to speak, was necessary to\r\nthe historical continuity of the marriage-tie. On the contrary, having\r\nthe amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and\r\ndisinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful\r\nnature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him spun\r\nlittle threads of tenderness from out his heart towards hers.\r\n\r\nThus it happened, that after Sir James had ridden rather fast for half\r\nan hour in a direction away from Tipton Grange, he slackened his pace,\r\nand at last turned into a road which would lead him back by a shorter\r\ncut. Various feelings wrought in him the determination after all to go\r\nto the Grange to-day as if nothing new had happened. He could not help\r\nrejoicing that he had never made the offer and been rejected; mere\r\nfriendly politeness required that he should call to see Dorothea about\r\nthe cottages, and now happily Mrs. Cadwallader had prepared him to\r\noffer his congratulations, if necessary, without showing too much\r\nawkwardness. He really did not like it: giving up Dorothea was very\r\npainful to him; but there was something in the resolve to make this\r\nvisit forthwith and conquer all show of feeling, which was a sort of\r\nfile-biting and counter-irritant. And without his distinctly\r\nrecognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him the sense\r\nthat Celia would be there, and that he should pay her more attention\r\nthan he had done before.\r\n\r\nWe mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between\r\nbreakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale\r\nabout the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, “Oh, nothing!” Pride\r\nhelps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide\r\nour own hurts—not to hurt others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n“Piacer e popone\r\nVuol la sua stagione.”\r\n—_Italian Proverb_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at\r\nthe Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned\r\nto the progress of his great work—the Key to all Mythologies—naturally\r\nmade him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of\r\ncourtship. But he had deliberately incurred the hindrance, having made\r\nup his mind that it was now time for him to adorn his life with the\r\ngraces of female companionship, to irradiate the gloom which fatigue\r\nwas apt to hang over the intervals of studious labor with the play of\r\nfemale fancy, and to secure in this, his culminating age, the solace of\r\nfemale tendance for his declining years. Hence he determined to abandon\r\nhimself to the stream of feeling, and perhaps was surprised to find\r\nwhat an exceedingly shallow rill it was. As in droughty regions baptism\r\nby immersion could only be performed symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found\r\nthat sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream\r\nwould afford him; and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated\r\nthe force of masculine passion. Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure\r\nthat Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised\r\nto fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage. It had once or\r\ntwice crossed his mind that possibly there was some deficiency in\r\nDorothea to account for the moderation of his abandonment; but he was\r\nunable to discern the deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who\r\nwould have pleased him better; so that there was clearly no reason to\r\nfall back upon but the exaggerations of human tradition.\r\n\r\n“Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?” said Dorothea\r\nto him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; “could I not learn\r\nto read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton’s daughters did to\r\ntheir father, without understanding what they read?”\r\n\r\n“I fear that would be wearisome to you,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling;\r\n“and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned\r\nregarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion\r\nagainst the poet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they\r\nwould have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second\r\nplace they might have studied privately and taught themselves to\r\nunderstand what they read, and then it would have been interesting. I\r\nhope you don’t expect me to be naughty and stupid?”\r\n\r\n“I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every\r\npossible relation of life. Certainly it might be a great advantage if\r\nyou were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it were well\r\nto begin with a little reading.”\r\n\r\nDorothea seized this as a precious permission. She would not have asked\r\nMr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages, dreading of all things\r\nto be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely out of\r\ndevotion to her future husband that she wished to know Latin and Greek.\r\nThose provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her a standing-ground\r\nfrom which all truth could be seen more truly. As it was, she\r\nconstantly doubted her own conclusions, because she felt her own\r\nignorance: how could she be confident that one-roomed cottages were not\r\nfor the glory of God, when men who knew the classics appeared to\r\nconciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory?\r\nPerhaps even Hebrew might be necessary—at least the alphabet and a few\r\nroots—in order to arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on\r\nthe social duties of the Christian. And she had not reached that point\r\nof renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a\r\nwise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself. Miss Brooke\r\nwas certainly very naive with all her alleged cleverness. Celia, whose\r\nmind had never been thought too powerful, saw the emptiness of other\r\npeople’s pretensions much more readily. To have in general but little\r\nfeeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any\r\nparticular occasion.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour\r\ntogether, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover,\r\nto whom a mistress’s elementary ignorance and difficulties have a\r\ntouching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching the\r\nalphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was a little\r\nshocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got\r\nto some timid questions about the value of the Greek accents gave her a\r\npainful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable\r\nof explanation to a woman’s reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with his\r\nusual strength upon it one day that he came into the library while the\r\nreading was going forward.\r\n\r\n“Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics,\r\nthat kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman—too taxing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,” said Mr.\r\nCasaubon, evading the question. “She had the very considerate thought\r\nof saving my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, without understanding, you know—that may not be so bad. But\r\nthere is a lightness about the feminine mind—a touch and go—music, the\r\nfine arts, that kind of thing—they should study those up to a certain\r\npoint, women should; but in a light way, you know. A woman should be\r\nable to sit down and play you or sing you a good old English tune. That\r\nis what I like; though I have heard most things—been at the opera in\r\nVienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of that sort. But I’m a conservative\r\nin music—it’s not like ideas, you know. I stick to the good old tunes.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he is not,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and feminine fine\r\nart must be forgiven her, considering the small tinkling and smearing\r\nin which they chiefly consisted at that dark period. She smiled and\r\nlooked up at her betrothed with grateful eyes. If he had always been\r\nasking her to play the “Last Rose of Summer,” she would have required\r\nmuch resignation. “He says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick,\r\nand it is covered with books.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very\r\nprettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does not\r\nlike it, you are all right. But it’s a pity you should not have little\r\nrecreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung—that kind of\r\nthing, you know—will not do.”\r\n\r\n“I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears\r\nteased with measured noises,” said Mr. Casaubon. “A tune much iterated\r\nhas the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort\r\nof minuet to keep time—an effect hardly tolerable, I imagine, after\r\nboyhood. As to the grander forms of music, worthy to accompany solemn\r\ncelebrations, and even to serve as an educating influence according to\r\nthe ancient conception, I say nothing, for with these we are not\r\nimmediately concerned.”\r\n\r\n“No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,” said Dorothea. “When we\r\nwere coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ\r\nat Freiberg, and it made me sob.”\r\n\r\n“That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n“Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to\r\ntake things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?”\r\n\r\nHe ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really\r\nthinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to so\r\nsober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.\r\n\r\n“It is wonderful, though,” he said to himself as he shuffled out of the\r\nroom—“it is wonderful that she should have liked him. However, the\r\nmatch is good. I should have been travelling out of my brief to have\r\nhindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will. He is pretty\r\ncertain to be a bishop, is Casaubon. That was a very seasonable\r\npamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:—a deanery at least. They owe\r\nhim a deanery.”\r\n\r\nAnd here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness, by\r\nremarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the\r\nRadical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make on the\r\nincomes of the bishops. What elegant historian would neglect a striking\r\nopportunity for pointing out that his heroes did not foresee the\r\nhistory of the world, or even their own actions?—For example, that\r\nHenry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a\r\nCatholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he measured his\r\nlaborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen\r\nmeasuring their idle days with watches. Here is a mine of truth, which,\r\nhowever vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.\r\n\r\nBut of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by\r\nprecedent—namely, that if he had foreknown his speech, it might not\r\nhave made any great difference. To think with pleasure of his niece’s\r\nhusband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thing—to make a\r\nLiberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which cannot\r\nlook at a subject from various points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n“Oh, rescue her! I am her brother now,\r\nAnd you her father. Every gentle maid\r\nShould have a guardian in each gentleman.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to like\r\ngoing to the Grange after he had once encountered the difficulty of\r\nseeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was\r\nengaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass\r\nthrough him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious\r\nthroughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it\r\nmust be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if\r\nhe had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match. He had no\r\nsense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that\r\nDorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost\r\nsome of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he had completely\r\nresigned her, since with the perversity of a Desdemona she had not\r\naffected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to\r\nnature; he could not yet be quite passive under the idea of her\r\nengagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when he first saw them together\r\nin the light of his present knowledge, it seemed to him that he had not\r\ntaken the affair seriously enough. Brooke was really culpable; he ought\r\nto have hindered it. Who could speak to him? Something might be done\r\nperhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage. On his way home he\r\nturned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the\r\nRector was at home, and his visitor was shown into the study, where all\r\nthe fishing tackle hung. But he himself was in a little room adjoining,\r\nat work with his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to\r\njoin him there. The two were better friends than any other landholder\r\nand clergyman in the county—a significant fact which was in agreement\r\nwith the amiable expression of their faces.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very\r\nplain and rough in his exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease\r\nand good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the\r\nsunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed\r\nof itself. “Well, how are you?” he said, showing a hand not quite fit\r\nto be grasped. “Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything\r\nparticular? You look vexed.”\r\n\r\nSir James’s brow had a little crease in it, a little depression of the\r\neyebrow, which he seemed purposely to exaggerate as he answered.\r\n\r\n“It is only this conduct of Brooke’s. I really think somebody should\r\nspeak to him.”\r\n\r\n“What? meaning to stand?” said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the\r\narrangement of the reels which he had just been turning. “I hardly\r\nthink he means it. But where’s the harm, if he likes it? Any one who\r\nobjects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don’t put up the\r\nstrongest fellow. They won’t overturn the Constitution with our friend\r\nBrooke’s head for a battering ram.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Sir James, who, after putting down his\r\nhat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and\r\nexamine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. “I mean this\r\nmarriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him—if the girl\r\nlikes him.”\r\n\r\n“She is too young to know what she likes. Her guardian ought to\r\ninterfere. He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong\r\nmanner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with daughters, can\r\nlook at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as yours!\r\nDo think seriously about it.”\r\n\r\n“I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,” said the Rector, with a\r\nprovoking little inward laugh. “You are as bad as Elinor. She has been\r\nwanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her\r\nfriends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly. “He must be fifty,\r\nand I don’t believe he could ever have been much more than the shadow\r\nof a man. Look at his legs!”\r\n\r\n“Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your\r\nown way in the world. You don’t understand women. They don’t admire you\r\nhalf so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell her sisters\r\nthat she married me for my ugliness—it was so various and amusing that\r\nit had quite conquered her prudence.”\r\n\r\n“You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no\r\nquestion of beauty. I don’t _like_ Casaubon.” This was Sir James’s\r\nstrongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man’s character.\r\n\r\n“Why? what do you know against him?” said the Rector laying down his\r\nreels, and putting his thumbs into his armholes with an air of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nSir James paused. He did not usually find it easy to give his reasons:\r\nit seemed to him strange that people should not know them without being\r\ntold, since he only felt what was reasonable. At last he said—\r\n\r\n“Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes. I don’t mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel,\r\n_that_ you may be sure of. He is very good to his poor relations:\r\npensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a\r\ngood deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his sense of justice. His\r\nmother’s sister made a bad match—a Pole, I think—lost herself—at any\r\nrate was disowned by her family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon\r\nwould not have had so much money by half. I believe he went himself to\r\nfind out his cousins, and see what he could do for them. Every man\r\nwould not ring so well as that, if you tried his metal. _You_ would,\r\nChettam; but not every man.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Sir James, coloring. “I am not so sure of myself.”\r\nHe paused a moment, and then added, “That was a right thing for\r\nCasaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be a\r\nsort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with him. And I think\r\nwhen a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her friends ought to\r\ninterfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish. You\r\nlaugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But\r\nupon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were\r\nMiss Brooke’s brother or uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but what should you do?”\r\n\r\n“I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of\r\nage. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I wish\r\nyou saw it as I do—I wish you would talk to Brooke about it.”\r\n\r\nSir James rose as he was finishing his sentence, for he saw Mrs.\r\nCadwallader entering from the study. She held by the hand her youngest\r\ngirl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made\r\ncomfortable on his knee.\r\n\r\n“I hear what you are talking about,” said the wife. “But you will make\r\nno impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his bait,\r\neverybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a\r\ntrout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: could\r\nthere be a better fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is something in that,” said the Rector, with his quiet,\r\ninward laugh. “It is a very good quality in a man to have a\r\ntrout-stream.”\r\n\r\n“But seriously,” said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent\r\nitself, “don’t you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I told you beforehand what he would say,” answered Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, lifting up her eyebrows. “I have done what I could: I wash\r\nmy hands of the marriage.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” said the Rector, looking rather grave, “it would\r\nbe nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make him act\r\naccordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into\r\nany mould, but he won’t keep shape.”\r\n\r\n“He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said Sir\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to Casaubon’s\r\ndisadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I should be\r\nacting for the advantage of Miss Brooke? I know no harm of Casaubon. I\r\ndon’t care about his Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and the rest; but then he\r\ndoesn’t care about my fishing-tackle. As to the line he took on the\r\nCatholic Question, that was unexpected; but he has always been civil to\r\nme, and I don’t see why I should spoil his sport. For anything I can\r\ntell, Miss Brooke may be happier with him than she would be with any\r\nother man.”\r\n\r\n“Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would rather dine\r\nunder the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have nothing to say to\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n“What has that to do with Miss Brooke’s marrying him? She does not do\r\nit for my amusement.”\r\n\r\n“He has got no good red blood in his body,” said Sir James.\r\n\r\n“No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all\r\nsemicolons and parentheses,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n\r\n“Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said Sir\r\nJames, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound feeling of\r\nan English layman.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains. They\r\nsay, when he was a little boy, he made an abstract of ‘Hop o’ my\r\nThumb,’ and he has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh! And that is\r\nthe man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he is what Miss Brooke likes,” said the Rector. “I don’t profess\r\nto understand every young lady’s taste.”\r\n\r\n“But if she were your own daughter?” said Sir James.\r\n\r\n“That would be a different affair. She is _not_ my daughter, and I\r\ndon’t feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of us.\r\nHe is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some Radical\r\nfellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned\r\nstraw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar incumbent,\r\nand I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don’t see that one\r\nis worse or better than the other.” The Rector ended with his silent\r\nlaugh. He always saw the joke of any satire against himself. His\r\nconscience was large and easy, like the rest of him: it did only what\r\nit could do without any trouble.\r\n\r\nClearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke’s marriage\r\nthrough Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that she\r\nwas to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was a sign of his good\r\ndisposition that he did not slacken at all in his intention of carrying\r\nout Dorothea’s design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was\r\nthe best course for his own dignity: but pride only helps us to be\r\ngenerous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty.\r\nShe was now enough aware of Sir James’s position with regard to her, to\r\nappreciate the rectitude of his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to\r\nwhich he had at first been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her\r\npleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her\r\npresent happiness. Perhaps she gave to Sir James Chettam’s cottages all\r\nthe interest she could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the\r\nsymphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self\r\ndevotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in her soul.\r\nHence it happened that in the good baronet’s succeeding visits, while\r\nhe was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found himself\r\ntalking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She was perfectly\r\nunconstrained and without irritation towards him now, and he was\r\ngradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and\r\ncompanionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or\r\nconfess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_. An ancient land in ancient oracles\r\n    Is called “law-thirsty”: all the struggle there\r\n    Was after order and a perfect rule.\r\n    Pray, where lie such lands now? . . .\r\n\r\n2_d Gent_. Why, where they lay of old—in human souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon’s behavior about settlements was highly satisfactory to\r\nMr. Brooke, and the preliminaries of marriage rolled smoothly along,\r\nshortening the weeks of courtship. The betrothed bride must see her\r\nfuture home, and dictate any changes that she would like to have made\r\nthere. A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an\r\nappetite for submission afterwards. And certainly, the mistakes that we\r\nmale and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly\r\nraise some wonder that we are so fond of it.\r\n\r\nOn a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company\r\nwith her uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon’s home was the manor-house.\r\nClose by, visible from some parts of the garden, was the little church,\r\nwith the old parsonage opposite. In the beginning of his career, Mr.\r\nCasaubon had only held the living, but the death of his brother had put\r\nhim in possession of the manor also. It had a small park, with a fine\r\nold oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest\r\nfront, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from\r\nthe drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope\r\nof greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures,\r\nwhich often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun. This was\r\nthe happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather\r\nmelancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were more\r\nconfined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large\r\nclumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards\r\nfrom the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the old\r\nEnglish style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the\r\nsort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and\r\nlittle vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home. In this\r\nlatter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves falling\r\nslowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without sunshine, the\r\nhouse too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr. Casaubon, when he\r\npresented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown into relief by\r\nthat background.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear!” Celia said to herself, “I am sure Freshitt Hall would have\r\nbeen pleasanter than this.” She thought of the white freestone, the\r\npillared portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling\r\nabove them like a prince issuing from his enchantment in a rose-bush,\r\nwith a handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from the most delicately\r\nodorous petals—Sir James, who talked so agreeably, always about things\r\nwhich had common-sense in them, and not about learning! Celia had those\r\nlight young feminine tastes which grave and weatherworn gentlemen\r\nsometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon’s bias had been\r\ndifferent, for he would have had no chance with Celia.\r\n\r\nDorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she\r\ncould wish: the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and\r\ncurtains with colors subdued by time, the curious old maps and\r\nbird’s-eye views on the walls of the corridor, with here and there an\r\nold vase below, had no oppression for her, and seemed more cheerful\r\nthan the casts and pictures at the Grange, which her uncle had long ago\r\nbrought home from his travels—they being probably among the ideas he\r\nhad taken in at one time. To poor Dorothea these severe classical\r\nnudities and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully\r\ninexplicable, staring into the midst of her Puritanic conceptions: she\r\nhad never been taught how she could bring them into any sort of\r\nrelevance with her life. But the owners of Lowick apparently had not\r\nbeen travellers, and Mr. Casaubon’s studies of the past were not\r\ncarried on by means of such aids.\r\n\r\nDorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion. Everything\r\nseemed hallowed to her: this was to be the home of her wifehood, and\r\nshe looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew\r\nher attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she\r\nwould like an alteration. All appeals to her taste she met gratefully,\r\nbut saw nothing to alter. His efforts at exact courtesy and formal\r\ntenderness had no defect for her. She filled up all blanks with\r\nunmanifested perfections, interpreting him as she interpreted the works\r\nof Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her own deafness\r\nto the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in the weeks of\r\ncourtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear Dorothea, I wish you to favor me by pointing out which\r\nroom you would like to have as your boudoir,” said Mr. Casaubon,\r\nshowing that his views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to\r\ninclude that requirement.\r\n\r\n“It is very kind of you to think of that,” said Dorothea, “but I assure\r\nyou I would rather have all those matters decided for me. I shall be\r\nmuch happier to take everything as it is—just as you have been used to\r\nhave it, or as you will yourself choose it to be. I have no motive for\r\nwishing anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dodo,” said Celia, “will you not have the bow-windowed room\r\nup-stairs?”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon led the way thither. The bow-window looked down the avenue\r\nof limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were\r\nminiatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a\r\ngroup. A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a blue-green world\r\nwith a pale stag in it. The chairs and tables were thin-legged and easy\r\nto upset. It was a room where one might fancy the ghost of a\r\ntight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her embroidery. A light\r\nbookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf,\r\ncompleting the furniture.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, “this would be a pretty room with some new\r\nhangings, sofas, and that sort of thing. A little bare now.”\r\n\r\n“No, uncle,” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Pray do not speak of altering\r\nanything. There are so many other things in the world that want\r\naltering—I like to take these things as they are. And you like them as\r\nthey are, don’t you?” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon. “Perhaps this\r\nwas your mother’s room when she was young.”\r\n\r\n“It was,” he said, with his slow bend of the head.\r\n\r\n“This is your mother,” said Dorothea, who had turned to examine the\r\ngroup of miniatures. “It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I\r\nshould think, a better portrait. And this one opposite, who is this?”\r\n\r\n“Her elder sister. They were, like you and your sister, the only two\r\nchildren of their parents, who hang above them, you see.”\r\n\r\n“The sister is pretty,” said Celia, implying that she thought less\r\nfavorably of Mr. Casaubon’s mother. It was a new opening to Celia’s\r\nimagination, that he came of a family who had all been young in their\r\ntime—the ladies wearing necklaces.\r\n\r\n“It is a peculiar face,” said Dorothea, looking closely. “Those deep\r\ngray eyes rather near together—and the delicate irregular nose with a\r\nsort of ripple in it—and all the powdered curls hanging backward.\r\nAltogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty. There is not\r\neven a family likeness between her and your mother.”\r\n\r\n“No. And they were not alike in their lot.”\r\n\r\n“You did not mention her to me,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“My aunt made an unfortunate marriage. I never saw her.”\r\n\r\nDorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just\r\nthen to ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and\r\nshe turned to the window to admire the view. The sun had lately pierced\r\nthe gray, and the avenue of limes cast shadows.\r\n\r\n“Shall we not walk in the garden now?” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“And you would like to see the church, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “It\r\nis a droll little church. And the village. It all lies in a nut-shell.\r\nBy the way, it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are like a row\r\nof alms-houses—little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, please,” said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I should like\r\nto see all that.” She had got nothing from him more graphic about the\r\nLowick cottages than that they were “not bad.”\r\n\r\nThey were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy\r\nborders and clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church,\r\nMr. Casaubon said. At the little gate leading into the churchyard there\r\nwas a pause while Mr. Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to fetch\r\na key. Celia, who had been hanging a little in the rear, came up\r\npresently, when she saw that Mr. Casaubon was gone away, and said in\r\nher easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict the suspicion of\r\nany malicious intent—\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the\r\nwalks.”\r\n\r\n“Is that astonishing, Celia?”\r\n\r\n“There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke. “I\r\ntold Casaubon he should change his gardener.”\r\n\r\n“No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book. He\r\nhad light-brown curls. I only saw his back. But he was quite young.”\r\n\r\n“The curate’s son, perhaps,” said Mr. Brooke. “Ah, there is Casaubon\r\nagain, and Tucker with him. He is going to introduce Tucker. You don’t\r\nknow Tucker yet.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,”\r\nwho are usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the\r\nconversation did not lead to any question about his family, and the\r\nstartling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but\r\nCelia. She inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and\r\nslim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as\r\nold and musty-looking as she would have expected Mr. Casaubon’s curate\r\nto be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven (for Celia\r\nwished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so\r\nunpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should\r\nhave to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no\r\npretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had\r\nnot been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to\r\nanswer all Dorothea’s questions about the villagers and the other\r\nparishioners. Everybody, he assured her, was well off in Lowick: not a\r\ncottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the\r\nstrips of garden at the back were well tended. The small boys wore\r\nexcellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a\r\nlittle straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though\r\nthe public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards\r\nspirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so\r\nnumerous that Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for\r\nthe women to glean, I see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in\r\ntheir pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his people. The\r\nFrench eat a good many fowls—skinny fowls, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly.\r\n“Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal\r\nvirtue?”\r\n\r\n“And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be\r\nnice. But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was\r\nsubauditum; that is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said\r\nMr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his head towards Celia, who\r\nimmediately dropped backward a little, because she could not bear Mr.\r\nCasaubon to blink at her.\r\n\r\nDorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt some\r\ndisappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing\r\nfor her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had\r\nglanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of\r\nfinding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of\r\nthe world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in\r\nit. Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a\r\npicture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she\r\nwould await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the higher\r\nknowledge gained by her in that companionship.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not\r\nallow him to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden\r\nthrough the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—\r\n\r\n“You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what you\r\nhave seen.”\r\n\r\n“I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered\r\nDorothea, with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people\r\nwanted more to be done for them here. I have known so few ways of\r\nmaking my life good for anything. Of course, my notions of usefulness\r\nmust be narrow. I must learn new ways of helping people.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” said Mr. Casaubon. “Each position has its corresponding\r\nduties. Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any\r\nyearning unfulfilled.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “Do not suppose\r\nthat I am sad.”\r\n\r\n“That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to\r\nthe house than that by which we came.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a\r\nfine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side\r\nof the house. As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark\r\nbackground of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old\r\ntree. Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his head,\r\nand said—\r\n\r\n“Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”\r\n\r\nThey had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—\r\n\r\n“That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in\r\nfact,” he added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you\r\nhave been noticing, my aunt Julia.”\r\n\r\nThe young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen. His bushy\r\nlight-brown curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once\r\nwith Celia’s apparition.\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this\r\nis Miss Brooke.”\r\n\r\nThe cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea\r\ncould see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate\r\nirregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward;\r\nbut there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect\r\nthan belonged to the type of the grandmother’s miniature. Young\r\nLadislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with\r\nthis introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but\r\nwore rather a pouting air of discontent.\r\n\r\n“You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book\r\nand turning it over in his unceremonious fashion.\r\n\r\n“No, I only sketch a little. There is nothing fit to be seen there,”\r\nsaid young Ladislaw, coloring, perhaps with temper rather than modesty.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now. I did a little in this way myself\r\nat one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice\r\nthing, done with what we used to call _brio_.” Mr. Brooke held out\r\ntowards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees,\r\nwith a pool.\r\n\r\n“I am no judge of these things,” said Dorothea, not coldly, but with an\r\neager deprecation of the appeal to her. “You know, uncle, I never see\r\nthe beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised. They\r\nare a language I do not understand. I suppose there is some relation\r\nbetween pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel—just as you\r\nsee what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.”\r\nDorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his head towards her,\r\nwhile Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly—\r\n\r\n“Bless me, now, how different people are! But you had a bad style of\r\nteaching, you know—else this is just the thing for girls—sketching,\r\nfine art and so on. But you took to drawing plans; you don’t understand\r\n_morbidezza_, and that kind of thing. You will come to my house, I\r\nhope, and I will show you what I did in this way,” he continued,\r\nturning to young Ladislaw, who had to be recalled from his\r\npreoccupation in observing Dorothea. Ladislaw had made up his mind that\r\nshe must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon,\r\nand what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed\r\nthat opinion even if he had believed her. As it was, he took her words\r\nfor a covert judgment, and was certain that she thought his sketch\r\ndetestable. There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was\r\nlaughing both at her uncle and himself. But what a voice! It was like\r\nthe voice of a soul that had once lived in an Aeolian harp. This must\r\nbe one of Nature’s inconsistencies. There could be no sort of passion\r\nin a girl who would marry Casaubon. But he turned from her, and bowed\r\nhis thanks for Mr. Brooke’s invitation.\r\n\r\n“We will turn over my Italian engravings together,” continued that\r\ngood-natured man. “I have no end of those things, that I have laid by\r\nfor years. One gets rusty in this part of the country, you know. Not\r\nyou, Casaubon; you stick to your studies; but my best ideas get\r\nundermost—out of use, you know. You clever young men must guard against\r\nindolence. I was too indolent, you know: else I might have been\r\nanywhere at one time.”\r\n\r\n“That is a seasonable admonition,” said Mr. Casaubon; “but now we will\r\npass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of\r\nstanding.”\r\n\r\nWhen their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his\r\nsketching, and as he did so his face broke into an expression of\r\namusement which increased as he went on drawing, till at last he threw\r\nback his head and laughed aloud. Partly it was the reception of his own\r\nartistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave\r\ncousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of\r\nthe place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence. Mr.\r\nWill Ladislaw’s sense of the ludicrous lit up his features very\r\nagreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and had no mixture\r\nof sneering and self-exaltation.\r\n\r\n“What is your nephew going to do with himself, Casaubon?” said Mr.\r\nBrooke, as they went on.\r\n\r\n“My cousin, you mean—not my nephew.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, cousin. But in the way of a career, you know.”\r\n\r\n“The answer to that question is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby he\r\ndeclined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have\r\nplaced him, and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of\r\nstudying at Heidelberg. And now he wants to go abroad again, without\r\nany special object, save the vague purpose of what he calls culture,\r\npreparation for he knows not what. He declines to choose a profession.”\r\n\r\n“He has no means but what you furnish, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“I have always given him and his friends reason to understand that I\r\nwould furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him with a\r\nscholarly education, and launching him respectably. I am therefore\r\nbound to fulfil the expectation so raised,” said Mr. Casaubon, putting\r\nhis conduct in the light of mere rectitude: a trait of delicacy which\r\nDorothea noticed with admiration.\r\n\r\n“He has a thirst for travelling; perhaps he may turn out a Bruce or a\r\nMungo Park,” said Mr. Brooke. “I had a notion of that myself at one\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“No, he has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our\r\ngeognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with\r\nsome approbation, though without felicitating him on a career which so\r\noften ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he from having\r\nany desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth’s surface, that\r\nhe said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that\r\nthere should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for\r\nthe poetic imagination.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is something in that, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, who had\r\ncertainly an impartial mind.\r\n\r\n“It is, I fear, nothing more than a part of his general inaccuracy and\r\nindisposition to thoroughness of all kinds, which would be a bad augury\r\nfor him in any profession, civil or sacred, even were he so far\r\nsubmissive to ordinary rule as to choose one.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he has conscientious scruples founded on his own unfitness,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, who was interesting herself in finding a favorable\r\nexplanation. “Because the law and medicine should be very serious\r\nprofessions to undertake, should they not? People’s lives and fortunes\r\ndepend on them.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly\r\ndetermined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady\r\napplication, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful\r\ninstrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to\r\nself-indulgent taste. I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has\r\nstated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work\r\nregarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or\r\nacquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience. I have\r\npointed to my own manuscript volumes, which represent the toil of years\r\npreparatory to a work not yet accomplished. But in vain. To careful\r\nreasoning of this kind he replies by calling himself Pegasus, and every\r\nform of prescribed work ‘harness.’”\r\n\r\nCelia laughed. She was surprised to find that Mr. Casaubon could say\r\nsomething quite amusing.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, he may turn out a Byron, a Chatterton, a\r\nChurchill—that sort of thing—there’s no telling,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n“Shall you let him go to Italy, or wherever else he wants to go?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have agreed to furnish him with moderate supplies for a year or\r\nso; he asks no more. I shall let him be tried by the test of freedom.”\r\n\r\n“That is very kind of you,” said Dorothea, looking up at Mr. Casaubon\r\nwith delight. “It is noble. After all, people may really have in them\r\nsome vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not?\r\nThey may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be very\r\npatient with each other, I think.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think\r\npatience good,” said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone\r\ntogether, taking off their wrappings.\r\n\r\n“You mean that I am very impatient, Celia.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; when people don’t do and say just what you like.” Celia had\r\nbecome less afraid of “saying things” to Dorothea since this\r\nengagement: cleverness seemed to her more pitiable than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n“He had catched a great cold, had he had no other clothes to wear than\r\nthe skin of a bear not yet killed.”—FULLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited\r\nhim, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his young\r\nrelative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness\r\nto waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise\r\ndestination than the entire area of Europe. Genius, he held, is\r\nnecessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the\r\nutmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await\r\nthose messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work,\r\nonly placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime\r\nchances. The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had\r\nsincerely tried many of them. He was not excessively fond of wine, but\r\nhe had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that\r\nform of ecstasy; he had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on\r\nlobster; he had made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly\r\noriginal had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium\r\nhad convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his\r\nconstitution and De Quincey’s. The superadded circumstance which would\r\nevolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.\r\nEven Caesar’s fortune at one time was but a grand presentiment. We know\r\nwhat a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes may be\r\ndisguised in helpless embryos. In fact, the world is full of hopeful\r\nanalogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities. Will saw\r\nclearly enough the pitiable instances of long incubation producing no\r\nchick, and but for gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose\r\nplodding application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned\r\ntheory exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a\r\nmoral entirely encouraging to Will’s generous reliance on the\r\nintentions of the universe with regard to himself. He held that\r\nreliance to be a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the\r\ncontrary; genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility,\r\nbut in a power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in\r\nparticular. Let him start for the Continent, then, without our\r\npronouncing on his future. Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the\r\nmost gratuitous.\r\n\r\nBut at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me\r\nmore in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his young cousin. If to\r\nDorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight\r\nthe fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions, does it follow\r\nthat he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned\r\npersonages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him?\r\nI protest against any absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from\r\nMrs. Cadwallader’s contempt for a neighboring clergyman’s alleged\r\ngreatness of soul, or Sir James Chettam’s poor opinion of his rival’s\r\nlegs,—from Mr. Brooke’s failure to elicit a companion’s ideas, or from\r\nCelia’s criticism of a middle-aged scholar’s personal appearance. I am\r\nnot sure that the greatest man of his age, if ever that solitary\r\nsuperlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of\r\nhimself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his\r\nportrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.\r\nMoreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has rather a chilling\r\nrhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or\r\nfine feeling in him. Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of\r\nhieroglyphs write detestable verses? Has the theory of the solar system\r\nbeen advanced by graceful manners and conversational tact? Suppose we\r\nturn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest,\r\nwhat is the report of his own consciousness about his doings or\r\ncapacity: with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what\r\nfading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are\r\nmarking off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against\r\nuniversal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring\r\nhis heart to its final pause. Doubtless his lot is important in his own\r\neyes; and the chief reason that we think he asks too large a place in\r\nour consideration must be our want of room for him, since we refer him\r\nto the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is even held\r\nsublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there, however little he\r\nmay have got from us. Mr. Casaubon, too, was the centre of his own\r\nworld; if he was liable to think that others were providentially made\r\nfor him, and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness\r\nfor the author of a “Key to all Mythologies,” this trait is not quite\r\nalien to us, and, like the other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims\r\nsome of our pity.\r\n\r\nCertainly this affair of his marriage with Miss Brooke touched him more\r\nnearly than it did any one of the persons who have hitherto shown their\r\ndisapproval of it, and in the present stage of things I feel more\r\ntenderly towards his experience of success than towards the\r\ndisappointment of the amiable Sir James. For in truth, as the day fixed\r\nfor his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits\r\nrising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene,\r\nwhere, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with\r\nflowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed\r\nvaults where he walked taper in hand. He did not confess to himself,\r\nstill less could he have breathed to another, his surprise that though\r\nhe had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had not won\r\ndelight,—which he had also regarded as an object to be found by search.\r\nIt is true that he knew all the classical passages implying the\r\ncontrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion,\r\nwhich explains why they leave so little extra force for their personal\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious bachelorhood had\r\nstored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large\r\ndrafts on his affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of\r\nus, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act\r\nfatally on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of being\r\nsaddened by the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually\r\nhappy: there was nothing external by which he could account for a\r\ncertain blankness of sensibility which came over him just when his\r\nexpectant gladness should have been most lively, just when he exchanged\r\nthe accustomed dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the\r\nGrange. Here was a weary experience in which he was as utterly\r\ncondemned to loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened\r\nhim while toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to\r\nthe goal. And his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from\r\nsympathy. He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less\r\nhappy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be; and in\r\nrelation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration,\r\nhe liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening, as a means of\r\nencouragement to himself: in talking to her he presented all his\r\nperformance and intention with the reflected confidence of the\r\npedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience\r\nwhich crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure\r\nof Tartarean shades.\r\n\r\nFor to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted to\r\nyoung ladies which had made the chief part of her education, Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s talk about his great book was full of new vistas; and this\r\nsense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to Stoics\r\nand Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike her own,\r\nkept in abeyance for the time her usual eagerness for a binding theory\r\nwhich could bring her own life and doctrine into strict connection with\r\nthat amazing past, and give the remotest sources of knowledge some\r\nbearing on her actions. That more complete teaching would come—Mr.\r\nCasaubon would tell her all that: she was looking forward to higher\r\ninitiation in ideas, as she was looking forward to marriage, and\r\nblending her dim conceptions of both. It would be a great mistake to\r\nsuppose that Dorothea would have cared about any share in Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s learning as mere accomplishment; for though opinion in the\r\nneighborhood of Freshitt and Tipton had pronounced her clever, that\r\nepithet would not have described her to circles in whose more precise\r\nvocabulary cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing,\r\napart from character. All her eagerness for acquirement lay within that\r\nfull current of sympathetic motive in which her ideas and impulses were\r\nhabitually swept along. She did not want to deck herself with\r\nknowledge—to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her\r\naction; and if she had written a book she must have done it as Saint\r\nTheresa did, under the command of an authority that constrained her\r\nconscience. But something she yearned for by which her life might be\r\nfilled with action at once rational and ardent; and since the time was\r\ngone by for guiding visions and spiritual directors, since prayer\r\nheightened yearning but not instruction, what lamp was there but\r\nknowledge? Surely learned men kept the only oil; and who more learned\r\nthan Mr. Casaubon?\r\n\r\nThus in these brief weeks Dorothea’s joyous grateful expectation was\r\nunbroken, and however her lover might occasionally be conscious of\r\nflatness, he could never refer it to any slackening of her affectionate\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending the\r\nwedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious for this\r\nbecause he wished to inspect some manuscripts in the Vatican.\r\n\r\n“I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us,” he said one\r\nmorning, some time after it had been ascertained that Celia objected to\r\ngo, and that Dorothea did not wish for her companionship. “You will\r\nhave many lonely hours, Dorothea, for I shall be constrained to make\r\nthe utmost use of my time during our stay in Rome, and I should feel\r\nmore at liberty if you had a companion.”\r\n\r\nThe words “I should feel more at liberty” grated on Dorothea. For the\r\nfirst time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she colored from annoyance.\r\n\r\n“You must have misunderstood me very much,” she said, “if you think I\r\nshould not enter into the value of your time—if you think that I should\r\nnot willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to the\r\nbest purpose.”\r\n\r\n“That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon, not\r\nin the least noticing that she was hurt; “but if you had a lady as your\r\ncompanion, I could put you both under the care of a cicerone, and we\r\ncould thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time.”\r\n\r\n“I beg you will not refer to this again,” said Dorothea, rather\r\nhaughtily. But immediately she feared that she was wrong, and turning\r\ntowards him she laid her hand on his, adding in a different tone, “Pray\r\ndo not be anxious about me. I shall have so much to think of when I am\r\nalone. And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion, just to take care\r\nof me. I could not bear to have Celia: she would be miserable.”\r\n\r\nIt was time to dress. There was to be a dinner-party that day, the last\r\nof the parties which were held at the Grange as proper preliminaries to\r\nthe wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once\r\non the sound of the bell, as if she needed more than her usual amount\r\nof preparation. She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she\r\ncould not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be\r\nuntruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her. Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s words had been quite reasonable, yet they had brought a\r\nvague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.\r\n\r\n“Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she said to\r\nherself. “How can I have a husband who is so much above me without\r\nknowing that he needs me less than I need him?”\r\n\r\nHaving convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she\r\nrecovered her equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene dignity\r\nwhen she came into the drawing-room in her silver-gray dress—the simple\r\nlines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow and coiled massively\r\nbehind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and\r\nexpression of all search after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was\r\nin company, there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her\r\nas if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking out from her\r\ntower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude made the\r\nenergy of her speech and emotion the more remarked when some outward\r\nappeal had touched her.\r\n\r\nShe was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for\r\nthe dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male\r\nportion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke’s\r\nnieces had resided with him, so that the talking was done in duos and\r\ntrios more or less inharmonious. There was the newly elected mayor of\r\nMiddlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic\r\nbanker his brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that\r\nsome called him a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the\r\nresources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.\r\nIn fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the\r\nMiddlemarchers, and that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner,\r\nwho drank her health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their\r\ngrandfathers’ furniture. For in that part of the country, before reform\r\nhad done its notable part in developing the political consciousness,\r\nthere was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of\r\nparties; so that Mr. Brooke’s miscellaneous invitations seemed to\r\nbelong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel and\r\nhabit of taking too much in the form of ideas.\r\n\r\nAlready, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was\r\nfound for some interjectional “asides.”\r\n\r\n“A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!” said Mr.\r\nStandish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned with the\r\nlanded gentry that he had become landed himself, and used that oath in\r\na deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the\r\nspeech of a man who held a good position.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman\r\ndisliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The remark was\r\ntaken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing\r\ncelebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few\r\nhairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of\r\na distinguished appearance.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself out a\r\nlittle more to please us. There should be a little filigree about a\r\nwoman—something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of challenge. The\r\nmore of a dead set she makes at you the better.”\r\n\r\n“There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.\r\n“And, by God, it’s usually the way with them. I suppose it answers some\r\nwise ends: Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?”\r\n\r\n“I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,” said Mr.\r\nBulstrode. “I should rather refer it to the devil.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,” said Mr.\r\nChichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been detrimental\r\nto his theology. “And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a\r\nswan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor’s daughter is more to my taste\r\nthan Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a marrying man I\r\nshould choose Miss Vincy before either of them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see the\r\nmiddle-aged fellows carry the day.”\r\n\r\nMr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to\r\nincur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely’s ideal was of\r\ncourse not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go too far,\r\nwould not have chosen that his nieces should meet the daughter of a\r\nMiddlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public occasion. The\r\nfeminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs.\r\nCadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel’s widow, was\r\nnot only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on\r\nthe ground of her complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed\r\nclearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need\r\nthe supplement of quackery. Lady Chettam, who attributed her own\r\nremarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical\r\nattendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs.\r\nRenfrew’s account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her\r\ncase of all strengthening medicines.\r\n\r\n“Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?” said the\r\nmild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively,\r\nwhen Mrs. Renfrew’s attention was called away.\r\n\r\n“It strengthens the disease,” said the Rector’s wife, much too\r\nwell-born not to be an amateur in medicine. “Everything depends on the\r\nconstitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile—that’s my\r\nview of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the\r\nmill.”\r\n\r\n“Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce—reduce the disease,\r\nyou know, if you are right, my dear. And I think what you say is\r\nreasonable.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly it is reasonable. You have two sorts of potatoes, fed on the\r\nsame soil. One of them grows more and more watery—”\r\n\r\n“Ah! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew—that is what I think. Dropsy! There is\r\nno swelling yet—it is inward. I should say she ought to take drying\r\nmedicines, shouldn’t you?—or a dry hot-air bath. Many things might be\r\ntried, of a drying nature.”\r\n\r\n“Let her try a certain person’s pamphlets,” said Mrs. Cadwallader in an\r\nundertone, seeing the gentlemen enter. “He does not want drying.”\r\n\r\n“Who, my dear?” said Lady Chettam, a charming woman, not so quick as to\r\nnullify the pleasure of explanation.\r\n\r\n“The bridegroom—Casaubon. He has certainly been drying up faster since\r\nthe engagement: the flame of passion, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“I should think he is far from having a good constitution,” said Lady\r\nChettam, with a still deeper undertone. “And then his studies—so very\r\ndry, as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Really, by the side of Sir James, he looks like a death’s head skinned\r\nover for the occasion. Mark my words: in a year from this time that\r\ngirl will hate him. She looks up to him as an oracle now, and by-and-by\r\nshe will be at the other extreme. All flightiness!”\r\n\r\n“How very shocking! I fear she is headstrong. But tell me—you know all\r\nabout him—is there anything very bad? What is the truth?”\r\n\r\n“The truth? he is as bad as the wrong physic—nasty to take, and sure to\r\ndisagree.”\r\n\r\n“There could not be anything worse than that,” said Lady Chettam, with\r\nso vivid a conception of the physic that she seemed to have learned\r\nsomething exact about Mr. Casaubon’s disadvantages. “However, James\r\nwill hear nothing against Miss Brooke. He says she is the mirror of\r\nwomen still.”\r\n\r\n“That is a generous make-believe of his. Depend upon it, he likes\r\nlittle Celia better, and she appreciates him. I hope you like my little\r\nCelia?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; she is fonder of geraniums, and seems more docile, though\r\nnot so fine a figure. But we were talking of physic. Tell me about this\r\nnew young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he is wonderfully clever: he\r\ncertainly looks it—a fine brow indeed.”\r\n\r\n“He is a gentleman. I heard him talking to Humphrey. He talks well.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Mr. Brooke says he is one of the Lydgates of Northumberland,\r\nreally well connected. One does not expect it in a practitioner of that\r\nkind. For my own part, I like a medical man more on a footing with the\r\nservants; they are often all the cleverer. I assure you I found poor\r\nHicks’s judgment unfailing; I never knew him wrong. He was coarse and\r\nbutcher-like, but he knew my constitution. It was a loss to me his\r\ngoing off so suddenly. Dear me, what a very animated conversation Miss\r\nBrooke seems to be having with this Mr. Lydgate!”\r\n\r\n“She is talking cottages and hospitals with him,” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick. “I\r\nbelieve he is a sort of philanthropist, so Brooke is sure to take him\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“James,” said Lady Chettam when her son came near, “bring Mr. Lydgate\r\nand introduce him to me. I want to test him.”\r\n\r\nThe affable dowager declared herself delighted with this opportunity of\r\nmaking Mr. Lydgate’s acquaintance, having heard of his success in\r\ntreating fever on a new plan.\r\n\r\nMr. Lydgate had the medical accomplishment of looking perfectly grave\r\nwhatever nonsense was talked to him, and his dark steady eyes gave him\r\nimpressiveness as a listener. He was as little as possible like the\r\nlamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless refinement about his\r\ntoilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam gathered much confidence in him.\r\nHe confirmed her view of her own constitution as being peculiar, by\r\nadmitting that all constitutions might be called peculiar, and he did\r\nnot deny that hers might be more peculiar than others. He did not\r\napprove of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on\r\nthe other hand, of incessant port wine and bark. He said “I think so”\r\nwith an air of so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement,\r\nthat she formed the most cordial opinion of his talents.\r\n\r\n“I am quite pleased with your protege,” she said to Mr. Brooke before\r\ngoing away.\r\n\r\n“My protege?—dear me!—who is that?” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n\r\n“This young Lydgate, the new doctor. He seems to me to understand his\r\nprofession admirably.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lydgate! he is not my protege, you know; only I knew an uncle of\r\nhis who sent me a letter about him. However, I think he is likely to be\r\nfirst-rate—has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has ideas, you\r\nknow—wants to raise the profession.”\r\n\r\n“Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and diet, that\r\nsort of thing,” resumed Mr. Brooke, after he had handed out Lady\r\nChettam, and had returned to be civil to a group of Middlemarchers.\r\n\r\n“Hang it, do you think that is quite sound?—upsetting the old\r\ntreatment, which has made Englishmen what they are?” said Mr. Standish.\r\n\r\n“Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who\r\nspoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly air. “I, for my part,\r\nhail the advent of Mr. Lydgate. I hope to find good reason for\r\nconfiding the new hospital to his management.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very fine,” replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond of Mr.\r\nBulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your hospital\r\npatients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection. But I\r\nam not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on\r\nme. I like treatment that has been tested a little.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an experiment-an\r\nexperiment, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you talk in that sense!” said Mr. Standish, with as much\r\ndisgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray towards a\r\nvaluable client.\r\n\r\n“I should be glad of any treatment that would cure me without reducing\r\nme to a skeleton, like poor Grainger,” said Mr. Vincy, the mayor, a\r\nflorid man, who would have served for a study of flesh in striking\r\ncontrast with the Franciscan tints of Mr. Bulstrode. “It’s an\r\nuncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding against the\r\nshafts of disease, as somebody said,—and I think it a very good\r\nexpression myself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lydgate, of course, was out of hearing. He had quitted the party\r\nearly, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty\r\nof certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke,\r\nwhose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage to that faded\r\nscholar, and her interest in matters socially useful, gave her the\r\npiquancy of an unusual combination.\r\n\r\n“She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too earnest,” he\r\nthought. “It is troublesome to talk to such women. They are always\r\nwanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of\r\nany question, and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle\r\nthings after their own taste.”\r\n\r\nEvidently Miss Brooke was not Mr. Lydgate’s style of woman any more\r\nthan Mr. Chichely’s. Considered, indeed, in relation to the latter,\r\nwhose mind was matured, she was altogether a mistake, and calculated to\r\nshock his trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young\r\nwomen to purplefaced bachelors. But Lydgate was less ripe, and might\r\npossibly have experience before him which would modify his opinion as\r\nto the most excellent things in woman.\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these gentlemen\r\nunder her maiden name. Not long after that dinner-party she had become\r\nMrs. Casaubon, and was on her way to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBut deeds and language such as men do use,\r\nAnd persons such as comedy would choose,\r\nWhen she would show an image of the times,\r\nAnd sport with human follies, not with crimes.\r\n—BEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLydgate, in fact, was already conscious of being fascinated by a woman\r\nstrikingly different from Miss Brooke: he did not in the least suppose\r\nthat he had lost his balance and fallen in love, but he had said of\r\nthat particular woman, “She is grace itself; she is perfectly lovely\r\nand accomplished. That is what a woman ought to be: she ought to\r\nproduce the effect of exquisite music.” Plain women he regarded as he\r\ndid the other severe facts of life, to be faced with philosophy and\r\ninvestigated by science. But Rosamond Vincy seemed to have the true\r\nmelodic charm; and when a man has seen the woman whom he would have\r\nchosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor\r\nwill usually depend on her resolution rather than on his. Lydgate\r\nbelieved that he should not marry for several years: not marry until he\r\nhad trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road\r\nwhich was quite ready made. He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon\r\nalmost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and\r\nmarried: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had\r\nassembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation\r\nwhich precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame. He\r\ntook a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his\r\ncourse, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable\r\nperturbation. But Lydgate was young, poor, ambitious. He had his\r\nhalf-century before him instead of behind him, and he had come to\r\nMiddlemarch bent on doing many things that were not directly fitted to\r\nmake his fortune or even secure him a good income. To a man under such\r\ncircumstances, taking a wife is something more than a question of\r\nadornment, however highly he may rate this; and Lydgate was disposed to\r\ngive it the first place among wifely functions. To his taste, guided by\r\na single conversation, here was the point on which Miss Brooke would be\r\nfound wanting, notwithstanding her undeniable beauty. She did not look\r\nat things from the proper feminine angle. The society of such women was\r\nabout as relaxing as going from your work to teach the second form,\r\ninstead of reclining in a paradise with sweet laughs for bird-notes,\r\nand blue eyes for a heaven.\r\n\r\nCertainly nothing at present could seem much less important to Lydgate\r\nthan the turn of Miss Brooke’s mind, or to Miss Brooke than the\r\nqualities of the woman who had attracted this young surgeon. But any\r\none watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a slow\r\npreparation of effects from one life on another, which tells like a\r\ncalculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we\r\nlook at our unintroduced neighbor. Destiny stands by sarcastic with our\r\ndramatis personae folded in her hand.\r\n\r\nOld provincial society had its share of this subtle movement: had not\r\nonly its striking downfalls, its brilliant young professional dandies\r\nwho ended by living up an entry with a drab and six children for their\r\nestablishment, but also those less marked vicissitudes which are\r\nconstantly shifting the boundaries of social intercourse, and begetting\r\nnew consciousness of interdependence. Some slipped a little downward,\r\nsome got higher footing: people denied aspirates, gained wealth, and\r\nfastidious gentlemen stood for boroughs; some were caught in political\r\ncurrents, some in ecclesiastical, and perhaps found themselves\r\nsurprisingly grouped in consequence; while a few personages or families\r\nthat stood with rocky firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly\r\npresenting new aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the\r\ndouble change of self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish\r\ngradually made fresh threads of connection—gradually, as the old\r\nstocking gave way to the savings-bank, and the worship of the solar\r\nguinea became extinct; while squires and baronets, and even lords who\r\nhad once lived blamelessly afar from the civic mind, gathered the\r\nfaultiness of closer acquaintanceship. Settlers, too, came from distant\r\ncounties, some with an alarming novelty of skill, others with an\r\noffensive advantage in cunning. In fact, much the same sort of movement\r\nand mixture went on in old England as we find in older Herodotus, who\r\nalso, in telling what had been, thought it well to take a woman’s lot\r\nfor his starting-point; though Io, as a maiden apparently beguiled by\r\nattractive merchandise, was the reverse of Miss Brooke, and in this\r\nrespect perhaps bore more resemblance to Rosamond Vincy, who had\r\nexcellent taste in costume, with that nymph-like figure and pure\r\nblondness which give the largest range to choice in the flow and color\r\nof drapery. But these things made only part of her charm. She was\r\nadmitted to be the flower of Mrs. Lemon’s school, the chief school in\r\nthe county, where the teaching included all that was demanded in the\r\naccomplished female—even to extras, such as the getting in and out of a\r\ncarriage. Mrs. Lemon herself had always held up Miss Vincy as an\r\nexample: no pupil, she said, exceeded that young lady for mental\r\nacquisition and propriety of speech, while her musical execution was\r\nquite exceptional. We cannot help the way in which people speak of us,\r\nand probably if Mrs. Lemon had undertaken to describe Juliet or Imogen,\r\nthese heroines would not have seemed poetical. The first vision of\r\nRosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any\r\nprejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon’s praise.\r\n\r\nLydgate could not be long in Middlemarch without having that agreeable\r\nvision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family;\r\nfor though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he had paid something to enter\r\non, had not been their doctor (Mrs. Vincy not liking the lowering\r\nsystem adopted by him), he had many patients among their connections\r\nand acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not\r\nconnected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old\r\nmanufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in\r\nwhich there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more\r\nor less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy’s sister had made a wealthy match\r\nin accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the\r\ntown, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done\r\nwell in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other\r\nhand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper’s\r\ndaughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for\r\nMrs. Vincy’s sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone,\r\nand had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might\r\nbe supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened\r\nthat Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock’s most\r\nimportant patients, had, from different causes, given an especially\r\ngood reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as\r\nwell as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family,\r\nvery early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate’s professional\r\ndiscretion, and there was no report about him which was not retailed at\r\nthe Vincys’, where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined\r\nto general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there was no need\r\nfor him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond\r\nsilently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired\r\nof the faces and figures she had always been used to—the various\r\nirregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those\r\nMiddlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at\r\nschool with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it\r\nwould have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in\r\nthese inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen\r\nto mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no\r\nhurry on the subject. An alderman about to be mayor must by-and-by\r\nenlarge his dinner-parties, but at present there were plenty of guests\r\nat his well-spread table.\r\n\r\nThat table often remained covered with the relics of the family\r\nbreakfast long after Mr. Vincy had gone with his second son to the\r\nwarehouse, and when Miss Morgan was already far on in morning lessons\r\nwith the younger girls in the schoolroom. It awaited the family\r\nlaggard, who found any sort of inconvenience (to others) less\r\ndisagreeable than getting up when he was called. This was the case one\r\nmorning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon\r\nvisiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with\r\nthe fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,\r\nRosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her embroidery longer\r\nthan usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her\r\nwork on her knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.\r\nHer mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on\r\nthe other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire\r\nplacidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to\r\nstrike, she looked up from the lace-mending which was occupying her\r\nplump fingers and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n“Knock at Mr. Fred’s door again, Pritchard, and tell him it has struck\r\nhalf-past ten.”\r\n\r\nThis was said without any change in the radiant good-humor of Mrs.\r\nVincy’s face, in which forty-five years had delved neither angles nor\r\nparallels; and pushing back her pink capstrings, she let her work rest\r\non her lap, while she looked admiringly at her daughter.\r\n\r\n“Mamma,” said Rosamond, “when Fred comes down I wish you would not let\r\nhim have red herrings. I cannot bear the smell of them all over the\r\nhouse at this hour of the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, you are so hard on your brothers! It is the only fault I\r\nhave to find with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but\r\nyou are so tetchy with your brothers.”\r\n\r\n“Not tetchy, mamma: you never hear me speak in an unladylike way.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but you want to deny them things.”\r\n\r\n“Brothers are so unpleasant.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, you must allow for young men. Be thankful if they have\r\ngood hearts. A woman must learn to put up with little things. You will\r\nbe married some day.”\r\n\r\n“Not to any one who is like Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t decry your own brother, my dear. Few young men have less against\r\nthem, although he couldn’t take his degree—I’m sure I can’t understand\r\nwhy, for he seems to me most clever. And you know yourself he was\r\nthought equal to the best society at college. So particular as you are,\r\nmy dear, I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly young man\r\nfor a brother. You are always finding fault with Bob because he is not\r\nFred.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, mamma, only because he is Bob.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not\r\nsomething against him.”\r\n\r\n“But”—here Rosamond’s face broke into a smile which suddenly revealed\r\ntwo dimples. She herself thought unfavorably of these dimples and\r\nsmiled little in general society. “But I shall not marry any\r\nMiddlemarch young man.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems, my love, for you have as good as refused the pick of\r\nthem; and if there’s better to be had, I’m sure there’s no girl better\r\ndeserves it.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, mamma—I wish you would not say, ‘the pick of them.’”\r\n\r\n“Why, what else are they?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, mamma, it is rather a vulgar expression.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely, my dear; I never was a good speaker. What should I say?”\r\n\r\n“The best of them.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that seems just as plain and common. If I had had time to think,\r\nI should have said, ‘the most superior young men.’ But with your\r\neducation you must know.”\r\n\r\n“What must Rosy know, mother?” said Mr. Fred, who had slid in\r\nunobserved through the half-open door while the ladies were bending\r\nover their work, and now going up to the fire stood with his back\r\ntowards it, warming the soles of his slippers.\r\n\r\n“Whether it’s right to say ‘superior young men,’” said Mrs. Vincy,\r\nringing the bell.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there are so many superior teas and sugars now. Superior is\r\ngetting to be shopkeepers’ slang.”\r\n\r\n“Are you beginning to dislike slang, then?” said Rosamond, with mild\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n“Only the wrong sort. All choice of words is slang. It marks a class.”\r\n\r\n“There is correct English: that is not slang.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write\r\nhistory and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of\r\npoets.”\r\n\r\n“You will say anything, Fred, to gain your point.”\r\n\r\n“Well, tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a\r\n_leg-plaiter_.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you can call it poetry if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Aha, Miss Rosy, you don’t know Homer from slang. I shall invent a new\r\ngame; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips, and give them to\r\nyou to separate.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, how amusing it is to hear young people talk!” said Mrs.\r\nVincy, with cheerful admiration.\r\n\r\n“Have you got nothing else for my breakfast, Pritchard?” said Fred, to\r\nthe servant who brought in coffee and buttered toast; while he walked\r\nround the table surveying the ham, potted beef, and other cold\r\nremnants, with an air of silent rejection, and polite forbearance from\r\nsigns of disgust.\r\n\r\n“Should you like eggs, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Eggs, no! Bring me a grilled bone.”\r\n\r\n“Really, Fred,” said Rosamond, when the servant had left the room, “if\r\nyou must have hot things for breakfast, I wish you would come down\r\nearlier. You can get up at six o’clock to go out hunting; I cannot\r\nunderstand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings.”\r\n\r\n“That is your want of understanding, Rosy. I can get up to go hunting\r\nbecause I like it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one\r\nelse and ordered grilled bone?”\r\n\r\n“I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady,” said Fred,\r\neating his toast with the utmost composure.\r\n\r\n“I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any\r\nmore than sisters.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t make myself disagreeable; it is you who find me so.\r\nDisagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my\r\nactions.”\r\n\r\n“I think it describes the smell of grilled bone.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. It describes a sensation in your little nose associated\r\nwith certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon’s\r\nschool. Look at my mother; you don’t see her objecting to everything\r\nexcept what she does herself. She is my notion of a pleasant woman.”\r\n\r\n“Bless you both, my dears, and don’t quarrel,” said Mrs. Vincy, with\r\nmotherly cordiality. “Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor. How\r\nis your uncle pleased with him?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty well, I think. He asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then\r\nscrews up his face while he hears the answers, as if they were pinching\r\nhis toes. That’s his way. Ah, here comes my grilled bone.”\r\n\r\n“But how came you to stay out so late, my dear? You only said you were\r\ngoing to your uncle’s.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dined at Plymdale’s. We had whist. Lydgate was there too.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of him? He is very gentlemanly, I suppose. They\r\nsay he is of excellent family—his relations quite county people.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Fred. “There was a Lydgate at John’s who spent no end of\r\nmoney. I find this man is a second cousin of his. But rich men may have\r\nvery poor devils for second cousins.”\r\n\r\n“It always makes a difference, though, to be of good family,” said\r\nRosamond, with a tone of decision which showed that she had thought on\r\nthis subject. Rosamond felt that she might have been happier if she had\r\nnot been the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer. She disliked\r\nanything which reminded her that her mother’s father had been an\r\ninnkeeper. Certainly any one remembering the fact might think that Mrs.\r\nVincy had the air of a very handsome good-humored landlady, accustomed\r\nto the most capricious orders of gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was odd his name was Tertius,” said the bright-faced\r\nmatron, “but of course it’s a name in the family. But now, tell us\r\nexactly what sort of man he is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, tallish, dark, clever—talks well—rather a prig, I think.”\r\n\r\n“I never can make out what you mean by a prig,” said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n“A fellow who wants to show that he has opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,” said Mrs. Vincy. “What are\r\nthey there for else?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother, the opinions they are paid for. But a prig is a fellow\r\nwho is always making you a present of his opinions.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, not without\r\na touch of innuendo.\r\n\r\n“Really, I can’t say.” said Fred, rather glumly, as he left the table,\r\nand taking up a novel which he had brought down with him, threw himself\r\ninto an arm-chair. “If you are jealous of her, go oftener to Stone\r\nCourt yourself and eclipse her.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would not be so vulgar, Fred. If you have finished, pray\r\nring the bell.”\r\n\r\n“It is true, though—what your brother says, Rosamond,” Mrs. Vincy\r\nbegan, when the servant had cleared the table. “It is a thousand pities\r\nyou haven’t patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of you as\r\nhe is, and wanted you to live with him. There’s no knowing what he\r\nmight have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I’m fond of\r\nhaving you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their\r\ngood. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do\r\nsomething for Mary Garth.”\r\n\r\n“Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court, because she likes that\r\nbetter than being a governess,” said Rosamond, folding up her work. “I\r\nwould rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring\r\nmuch of my uncle’s cough and his ugly relations.”\r\n\r\n“He can’t be long for this world, my dear; I wouldn’t hasten his end,\r\nbut what with asthma and that inward complaint, let us hope there is\r\nsomething better for him in another. And I have no ill-will towards\r\nMary Garth, but there’s justice to be thought of. And Mr.\r\nFeatherstone’s first wife brought him no money, as my sister did. Her\r\nnieces and nephews can’t have so much claim as my sister’s. And I must\r\nsay I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl—more fit for a governess.”\r\n\r\n“Every one would not agree with you there, mother,” said Fred, who\r\nseemed to be able to read and listen too.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, “if she _had_\r\nsome fortune left her,—a man marries his wife’s relations, and the\r\nGarths are so poor, and live in such a small way. But I shall leave you\r\nto your studies, my dear; for I must go and do some shopping.”\r\n\r\n“Fred’s studies are not very deep,” said Rosamond, rising with her\r\nmamma, “he is only reading a novel.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, by-and-by he’ll go to his Latin and things,” said Mrs.\r\nVincy, soothingly, stroking her son’s head. “There’s a fire in the\r\nsmoking-room on purpose. It’s your father’s wish, you know—Fred, my\r\ndear—and I always tell him you will be good, and go to college again to\r\ntake your degree.”\r\n\r\nFred drew his mother’s hand down to his lips, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you are not going out riding to-day?” said Rosamond,\r\nlingering a little after her mamma was gone.\r\n\r\n“No; why?”\r\n\r\n“Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now.”\r\n\r\n“You can go with me to-morrow, if you like. Only I am going to Stone\r\nCourt, remember.”\r\n\r\n“I want to ride so much, it is indifferent to me where we go.” Rosamond\r\nreally wished to go to Stone Court, of all other places.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say, Rosy,” said Fred, as she was passing out of the room, “if\r\nyou are going to the piano, let me come and play some airs with you.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not ask me this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Why not this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Fred, I wish you would leave off playing the flute. A man\r\nlooks very silly playing the flute. And you play so out of tune.”\r\n\r\n“When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him\r\nhow obliging you are.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute,\r\nany more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?”\r\n\r\n“And why should you expect me to take you out riding?”\r\n\r\nThis question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her mind on\r\nthat particular ride.\r\n\r\nSo Fred was gratified with nearly an hour’s practice of “Ar hyd y nos,”\r\n“Ye banks and braes,” and other favorite airs from his “Instructor on\r\nthe Flute;” a wheezy performance, into which he threw much ambition and\r\nan irrepressible hopefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nHe had more tow on his distaffe\r\nThan Gerveis knew.\r\n—CHAUCER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning,\r\nlay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and\r\npastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to\r\nspread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details gave each field a\r\nparticular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on them from\r\nchildhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees\r\nleaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in\r\nmid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope\r\nof the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the\r\nhuddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of\r\napproach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering\r\nwood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and\r\nvalleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel\r\nfar to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful. These\r\nare the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred\r\nsouls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart\r\nstanding between their father’s knees while he drove leisurely.\r\n\r\nBut the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have\r\nseen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into\r\nLowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles’\r\nriding. Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end of\r\nthe first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had\r\nbeen arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected\r\nbudding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from\r\nbecoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman\r\nfarmer. It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for the\r\ncluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts\r\non the right.\r\n\r\nPresently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on\r\nthe circular drive before the front door.\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Rosamond, “I hope none of my uncle’s horrible relations\r\nare there.”\r\n\r\n“They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule’s gig—the last yellow gig left, I\r\nshould think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how yellow can\r\nhave been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more funereal than a\r\nhearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on. How does she\r\nmanage it, Rosy? Her friends can’t always be dying.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know at all. And she is not in the least evangelical,” said\r\nRosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have\r\nfully accounted for perpetual crape. “And, not poor,” she added, after\r\na moment’s pause.\r\n\r\n“No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and\r\nFeatherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don’t want to spend\r\nanything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and are\r\nafraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family. But I\r\nbelieve he hates them all.”\r\n\r\nThe Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these\r\ndistant connections, had happened to say this very morning (not at all\r\nwith a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice\r\nheard through cotton wool) that she did not wish “to enjoy their good\r\nopinion.” She was seated, as she observed, on her own brother’s hearth,\r\nand had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had\r\nbeen Jane Waule, which entitled her to speak when her own brother’s\r\nname had been made free with by those who had no right to it.\r\n\r\n“What are you driving at there?” said Mr. Featherstone, holding his\r\nstick between his knees and settling his wig, while he gave her a\r\nmomentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him like a draught of\r\ncold air and set him coughing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waule had to defer her answer till he was quiet again, till Mary\r\nGarth had supplied him with fresh syrup, and he had begun to rub the\r\ngold knob of his stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It was a bright\r\nfire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of\r\nMrs. Waule’s face, which was as neutral as her voice; having mere\r\nchinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.\r\n\r\n“The doctors can’t master that cough, brother. It’s just like what I\r\nhave; for I’m your own sister, constitution and everything. But, as I\r\nwas saying, it’s a pity Mrs. Vincy’s family can’t be better conducted.”\r\n\r\n“Tchah! you said nothing o’ the sort. You said somebody had made free\r\nwith my name.”\r\n\r\n“And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true. My\r\nbrother Solomon tells me it’s the talk up and down in Middlemarch how\r\nunsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards\r\nsince home he came.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! What’s a game at billiards? It’s a good gentlemanly game;\r\nand young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to\r\nbilliards, now, he’d make a fool of himself.”\r\n\r\n“Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game, brother,\r\nand is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody\r\nsays is true, must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the\r\nfather’s pocket. For they say he’s been losing money for years, though\r\nnobody would think so, to see him go coursing and keeping open house as\r\nthey do. And I’ve heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond\r\nanything for her flightiness, and spoiling her children so.”\r\n\r\n“What’s Bulstrode to me? I don’t bank with him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy’s own sister, and they do say that\r\nMr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself,\r\nbrother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and\r\nthat light way of laughing at everything, it’s very unbecoming. But\r\nindulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay their\r\ndebts is another. And it’s openly said that young Vincy has raised\r\nmoney on his expectations. I don’t say what expectations. Miss Garth\r\nhears me, and is welcome to tell again. I know young people hang\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,” said Mary Garth. “I dislike hearing\r\nscandal too much to wish to repeat it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his stick and made a brief\r\nconvulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an\r\nold whist-player’s chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the fire,\r\nhe said—\r\n\r\n“And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn’t got expectations? Such a\r\nfine, spirited fellow is like enough to have ’em.”\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she did\r\nso, her voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though her\r\nface was still dry.\r\n\r\n“Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother\r\nSolomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such\r\nas may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones\r\nthan the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property\r\ncoming to _them_. And me your own sister, and Solomon your own brother!\r\nAnd if that’s to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to make\r\nfamilies for?” Here Mrs. Waule’s tears fell, but with moderation.\r\n\r\n“Come, out with it, Jane!” said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her. “You\r\nmean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him money\r\non what he says he knows about my will, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I never said so, brother” (Mrs. Waule’s voice had again become dry and\r\nunshaken). “It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he\r\ncalled coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me\r\nbeing a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady\r\nbeyond anything. And he had it from most undeniable authority, and not\r\none, but many.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense! I don’t believe a word of it. It’s all a got-up\r\nstory. Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse. See if the\r\ndoctor’s coming.”\r\n\r\n“Not got up by me, brother, nor yet by Solomon, who, whatever else he\r\nmay be—and I don’t deny he has oddities—has made his will and parted\r\nhis property equal between such kin as he’s friends with; though, for\r\nmy part, I think there are times when some should be considered more\r\nthan others. But Solomon makes it no secret what he means to do.”\r\n\r\n“The more fool he!” said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;\r\nbreaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to\r\nstand near him, so that she did not find out whose horses they were\r\nwhich presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Featherstone’s cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up\r\nher riding-habit with much grace. She bowed ceremoniously to Mrs.\r\nWaule, who said stiffly, “How do you do, miss?” smiled and nodded\r\nsilently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease,\r\nand allow her uncle to notice her.\r\n\r\n“Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color. Where’s Fred?”\r\n\r\n“Seeing about the horses. He will be in presently.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you’d better go.”\r\n\r\nEven those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had\r\nnever accused him of being insincerely polite, and his sister was quite\r\nused to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he marked his sense\r\nof blood-relationship. Indeed, she herself was accustomed to think that\r\nentire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in\r\nthe Almighty’s intentions about families. She rose slowly without any\r\nsign of resentment, and said in her usual muffled monotone, “Brother, I\r\nhope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon says\r\nthere’s great talk of his cleverness. I’m sure it’s my wish you should\r\nbe spared. And there’s none more ready to nurse you than your own\r\nsister and your own nieces, if you’d only say the word. There’s\r\nRebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, I remember—you’ll see I’ve remembered ’em all—all dark and\r\nugly. They’d need have some money, eh? There never was any beauty in\r\nthe women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some\r\nmoney, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A warm man was Waule.\r\nAy, ay; money’s a good egg; and if you’ve got money to leave behind\r\nyou, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs. Waule.” Here Mr. Featherstone\r\npulled at both sides of his wig as if he wanted to deafen himself, and\r\nhis sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of his.\r\nNotwithstanding her jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth, there\r\nremained as the nethermost sediment in her mental shallows a persuasion\r\nthat her brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his chief\r\nproperty away from his blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty\r\ncarried off his two wives both childless, after he had gained so much\r\nby manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why\r\nwas there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all\r\nsitting in the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next\r\nto them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter’s death, everybody was\r\nto know that the property was gone out of the family? The human mind\r\nhas at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a result\r\nwas not strictly conceivable. But we are frightened at much that is not\r\nstrictly conceivable.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred came in the old man eyed him with a peculiar twinkle, which\r\nthe younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the\r\nsatisfactory details of his appearance.\r\n\r\n“You two misses go away,” said Mr. Featherstone. “I want to speak to\r\nFred.”\r\n\r\n“Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little\r\nwhile,” said Mary. The two girls had not only known each other in\r\nchildhood, but had been at the same provincial school together (Mary as\r\nan articled pupil), so that they had many memories in common, and liked\r\nvery well to talk in private. Indeed, this _tête-à-tête_ was one of\r\nRosamond’s objects in coming to Stone Court.\r\n\r\nOld Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had been\r\nclosed. He continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with one\r\nof his habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening his mouth;\r\nand when he spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken for that\r\nof an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the tone of an\r\noffended senior. He was not a man to feel any strong moral indignation\r\neven on account of trespasses against himself. It was natural that\r\nothers should want to get an advantage over him, but then, he was a\r\nlittle too cunning for them.\r\n\r\n“So, sir, you’ve been paying ten per cent for money which you’ve\r\npromised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I’m dead and gone, eh?\r\nYou put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will yet.”\r\n\r\nFred blushed. He had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent\r\nreasons. But he was conscious of having spoken with some confidence\r\n(perhaps with more than he exactly remembered) about his prospect of\r\ngetting Featherstone’s land as a future means of paying present debts.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never borrowed\r\nany money on such an insecurity. Please do explain.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, it’s you must explain. I can alter my will yet, let me tell\r\nyou. I’m of sound mind—can reckon compound interest in my head, and\r\nremember every fool’s name as well as I could twenty years ago. What\r\nthe deuce? I’m under eighty. I say, you must contradict this story.”\r\n\r\n“I have contradicted it, sir,” Fred answered, with a touch of\r\nimpatience, not remembering that his uncle did not verbally\r\ndiscriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further\r\nfrom confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often\r\nwondered that so many fools took his own assertions for proofs. “But I\r\ncontradict it again. The story is a silly lie.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from authority.”\r\n\r\n“Name the authority, and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the\r\nmoney, and then I can disprove the story.”\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty good authority, I think—a man who knows most of what goes\r\non in Middlemarch. It’s that fine, religious, charitable uncle o’\r\nyours. Come now!” Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar inward shake\r\nwhich signified merriment.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bulstrode?”\r\n\r\n“Who else, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words\r\nhe may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named the man\r\nwho lent me the money?”\r\n\r\n“If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him. But,\r\nsupposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn’t get\r\nit—Bulstrode ’ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode\r\nto say he doesn’t believe you’ve ever promised to pay your debts out o’\r\nmy land. Come now!”\r\n\r\nMr. Featherstone’s face required its whole scale of grimaces as a\r\nmuscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\nFred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.\r\n\r\n“You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes\r\nscores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice against me.\r\nI could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the\r\nreport you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I\r\ncould hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe\r\nabout me.” Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to\r\nhis uncle’s vanity, “That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.”\r\nBut he was disappointed in the result.\r\n\r\n“Ay, I know what you mean. You’d sooner offend me than Bulstrode. And\r\nwhat’s he?—he’s got no land hereabout that ever I heard tell of. A\r\nspeckilating fellow! He may come down any day, when the devil leaves\r\noff backing him. And that’s what his religion means: he wants God\r\nA’mighty to come in. That’s nonsense! There’s one thing I made out\r\npretty clear when I used to go to church—and it’s this: God A’mighty\r\nsticks to the land. He promises land, and He gives land, and He makes\r\nchaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You like\r\nBulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his back to\r\nthe fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like neither Bulstrode\r\nnor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said old\r\nFeatherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show\r\nhimself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of land to make a\r\nsquire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred\r\npound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make five codicils if I\r\nlike, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg. It’s all one to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nFred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents of\r\nmoney, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the\r\nimmediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n“I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any kind\r\nintentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying\r\nhe doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay your debts\r\nout o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve got into, we’ll\r\nsee if I can’t back you a bit. Come now! That’s a bargain. Here, give\r\nme your arm. I’ll try and walk round the room.”\r\n\r\nFred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to be a\r\nlittle sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his\r\ndropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While\r\ngiving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to be an old\r\nfellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited\r\ngood-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks\r\nabout the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty\r\nbook-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,\r\nCulpepper, Klopstock’s “Messiah,” and several volumes of the\r\n“Gentleman’s Magazine.”\r\n\r\n“Read me the names o’ the books. Come now! you’re a college man.”\r\n\r\nFred gave him the titles.\r\n\r\n“What did missy want with more books? What must you be bringing her\r\nmore books for?”\r\n\r\n“They amuse her, sir. She is very fond of reading.”\r\n\r\n“A little too fond,” said Mr. Featherstone, captiously. “She was for\r\nreading when she sat with me. But I put a stop to that. She’s got the\r\nnewspaper to read out loud. That’s enough for one day, I should think.\r\nI can’t abide to see her reading to herself. You mind and not bring her\r\nany more books, do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I hear.” Fred had received this order before, and had\r\nsecretly disobeyed it. He intended to disobey it again.\r\n\r\n“Ring the bell,” said Mr. Featherstone; “I want missy to come down.”\r\n\r\nRosamond and Mary had been talking faster than their male friends. They\r\ndid not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the\r\nwindow while Rosamond took off her hat, adjusted her veil, and applied\r\nlittle touches of her finger-tips to her hair—hair of infantine\r\nfairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer\r\nstanding at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and\r\nthe one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,\r\ndeep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder\r\ncould put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner\r\nif these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in\r\nMiddlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure\r\ndisplayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most\r\nmen in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the\r\nbest girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on\r\nthe contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her\r\ncurly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it\r\nwould not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had\r\nall the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite\r\nas much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not\r\nfeigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate,\r\nto be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your\r\ncompanion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine\r\nveracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary\r\nhad certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle\r\nwhich are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they\r\nwere to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of\r\nresignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric\r\nbitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight,\r\nexcept by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of\r\ntelling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her\r\nso. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good\r\nhuman sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in\r\nall latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would\r\nhave painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features\r\nlook out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty,\r\ntruth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she neither tried\r\nto create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when\r\nshe was in a good mood she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself.\r\nWhen she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she\r\nsaid, laughingly—\r\n\r\n“What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy! You are the most\r\nunbecoming companion.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible and\r\nuseful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,” said\r\nRosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards\r\nthe new view of her neck in the glass.\r\n\r\n“You mean _my_ beauty,” said Mary, rather sardonically.\r\n\r\nRosamond thought, “Poor Mary, she takes the kindest things ill.” Aloud\r\nshe said, “What have you been doing lately?”\r\n\r\n“I? Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be amiable\r\nand contented—learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.”\r\n\r\n“It is a wretched life for you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. “I think my\r\nlife is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”\r\n\r\n“She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure\r\nthat everything gets easier as one gets older.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Rosamond, reflectively; “one wonders what such people do,\r\nwithout any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support. But,”\r\nshe added, dimpling, “it is very different with you, Mary. You may have\r\nan offer.”\r\n\r\n“Has any one told you he means to make me one?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with\r\nyou, seeing you almost every day.”\r\n\r\nA certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve\r\nnot to show any change.\r\n\r\n“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly;\r\n“it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.”\r\n\r\n“Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate\r\nis both.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into\r\nindifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added, not\r\nchoosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.\r\n\r\n“Merely, how you like him.”\r\n\r\n“There is no question of liking at present. My liking always wants some\r\nlittle kindness to kindle it. I am not magnanimous enough to like\r\npeople who speak to me without seeming to see me.”\r\n\r\n“Is he so haughty?” said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction. “You\r\nknow that he is of good family?”\r\n\r\n“No; he did not give that as a reason.”\r\n\r\n“Mary! you are the oddest girl. But what sort of looking man is he?\r\nDescribe him to me.”\r\n\r\n“How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy\r\neyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid\r\nwhite hands—and—let me see—oh, an exquisite cambric\r\npocket-handkerchief. But you will see him. You know this is about the\r\ntime of his visits.”\r\n\r\nRosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, “I rather like a\r\nhaughty manner. I cannot endure a rattling young man.”\r\n\r\n“I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but _il y en a pour\r\ntous les goûts_, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any girl can\r\nchoose the particular sort of conceit she would like, I should think it\r\nis you, Rosy.”\r\n\r\n“Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited.”\r\n\r\n“I wish no one said any worse of him. He should be more careful. Mrs.\r\nWaule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.” Mary spoke\r\nfrom a girlish impulse which got the better of her judgment. There was\r\na vague uneasiness associated with the word “unsteady” which she hoped\r\nRosamond might say something to dissipate. But she purposely abstained\r\nfrom mentioning Mrs. Waule’s more special insinuation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Fred is horrid!” said Rosamond. She would not have allowed herself\r\nso unsuitable a word to any one but Mary.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by horrid?”\r\n\r\n“He is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says he will not take\r\norders.”\r\n\r\n“I think Fred is quite right.”\r\n\r\n“How can you say he is quite right, Mary? I thought you had more sense\r\nof religion.”\r\n\r\n“He is not fit to be a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“But he ought to be fit.”—“Well, then, he is not what he ought to be. I\r\nknow some other people who are in the same case.”\r\n\r\n“But no one approves of them. I should not like to marry a clergyman;\r\nbut there must be clergymen.”\r\n\r\n“It does not follow that Fred must be one.”\r\n\r\n“But when papa has been at the expense of educating him for it! And\r\nonly suppose, if he should have no fortune left him?”\r\n\r\n“I can suppose that very well,” said Mary, dryly.\r\n\r\n“Then I wonder you can defend Fred,” said Rosamond, inclined to push\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n“I don’t defend him,” said Mary, laughing; “I would defend any parish\r\nfrom having him for a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“But of course if he were a clergyman, he must be different.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he would be a great hypocrite; and he is not that yet.”\r\n\r\n“It is of no use saying anything to you, Mary. You always take Fred’s\r\npart.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I not take his part?” said Mary, lighting up. “He would\r\ntake mine. He is the only person who takes the least trouble to oblige\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“You make me feel very uncomfortable, Mary,” said Rosamond, with her\r\ngravest mildness; “I would not tell mamma for the world.”\r\n\r\n“What would you not tell her?” said Mary, angrily.\r\n\r\n“Pray do not go into a rage, Mary,” said Rosamond, mildly as ever.\r\n\r\n“If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell her that\r\nI would not marry him if he asked me. But he is not going to do so,\r\nthat I am aware. He certainly never has asked me.”\r\n\r\n“Mary, you are always so violent.”\r\n\r\n“And you are always so exasperating.”\r\n\r\n“I? What can you blame me for?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating. There is the\r\nbell—I think we must go down.”\r\n\r\n“I did not mean to quarrel,” said Rosamond, putting on her hat.\r\n\r\n“Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarrelled. If one is not to get into a\r\nrage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?”\r\n\r\n“Am I to repeat what you have said?”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please. I never say what I am afraid of having repeated.\r\nBut let us go down.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long\r\nenough to see him; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him,\r\nand she herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of\r\nhis—“Flow on, thou shining river”—after she had sung “Home, sweet home”\r\n(which she detested). This hard-headed old Overreach approved of the\r\nsentimental song, as the suitable garnish for girls, and also as\r\nfundamentally fine, sentiment being the right thing for a song.\r\n\r\nMr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and\r\nassuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird’s, when Mr.\r\nLydgate’s horse passed the window.\r\n\r\nHis dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged\r\npatient—who can hardly believe that medicine would not “set him up” if\r\nthe doctor were only clever enough—added to his general disbelief in\r\nMiddlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision\r\nof Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to\r\nintroduce as his niece, though he had never thought it worth while to\r\nspeak of Mary Garth in that light. Nothing escaped Lydgate in\r\nRosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice\r\nwhich the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet\r\ngravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing\r\nthem afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with\r\nso much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining\r\nMary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in\r\nRosamond’s eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.\r\n\r\n“Miss Rosy has been singing me a song—you’ve nothing to say against\r\nthat, eh, doctor?” said Mr. Featherstone. “I like it better than your\r\nphysic.”\r\n\r\n“That has made me forget how the time was going,” said Rosamond, rising\r\nto reach her hat, which she had laid aside before singing, so that her\r\nflower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above her\r\nriding-habit. “Fred, we must really go.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in the\r\nbest spirits, and wanted to get away.\r\n\r\n“Miss Vincy is a musician?” said Lydgate, following her with his eyes.\r\n(Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness\r\nthat she was being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts\r\nthat entered into her _physique:_ she even acted her own character, and\r\nso well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.)\r\n\r\n“The best in Middlemarch, I’ll be bound,” said Mr. Featherstone, “let\r\nthe next be who she will. Eh, Fred? Speak up for your sister.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I’m out of court, sir. My evidence would be good for\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“Middlemarch has not a very high standard, uncle,” said Rosamond, with\r\na pretty lightness, going towards her whip, which lay at a distance.\r\n\r\nLydgate was quick in anticipating her. He reached the whip before she\r\ndid, and turned to present it to her. She bowed and looked at him: he\r\nof course was looking at her, and their eyes met with that peculiar\r\nmeeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden\r\ndivine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate turned a little paler than\r\nusual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.\r\nAfter that, she was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of\r\nstupidity her uncle was talking of when she went to shake hands with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called\r\nfalling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.\r\nEver since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a\r\nlittle future, of which something like this scene was the necessary\r\nbeginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly\r\nescorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a\r\ncircumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native\r\nmerit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely necessary\r\nto Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and\r\nbridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at\r\nall like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand\r\nthat he should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the\r\nstranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation,\r\nand Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life.\r\nShe judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held\r\nit still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at\r\nfirst sight of her. These things happened so often at balls, and why\r\nnot by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for\r\nit? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being\r\nfallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent\r\nand fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.\r\nAnd here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being\r\naltogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of\r\ndistinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections\r\nwhich offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of\r\ntalent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in\r\nfact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid\r\ninterest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be”\r\nsuch as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.\r\n\r\nThus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied\r\nand inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had\r\nthe usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic\r\nimagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before\r\nthey had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions\r\nof her wedded life, having determined on her house in Middlemarch, and\r\nforeseen the visits she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives\r\nat a distance, whose finished manners she could appropriate as\r\nthoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing\r\nherself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There\r\nwas nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared\r\nabout what were considered refinements, and not about the money that\r\nwas to pay for them.\r\n\r\nFred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his\r\nready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding\r\nFeatherstone’s stupid demand without incurring consequences which he\r\nliked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already\r\nout of humor with him, and would be still more so if he were the\r\noccasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the\r\nBulstrodes. Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle\r\nBulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish\r\nthings about Featherstone’s property, and these had been magnified by\r\nreport. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who\r\nbragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone,\r\nand went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those\r\nexpectations! He really had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative\r\nif he gave them up; besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him\r\nextremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The\r\nwhole affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his\r\nexpectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known men\r\nto whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his\r\nscrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic\r\nbitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and\r\ninevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring\r\nand Vyan—certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young\r\nfellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode’s name\r\nin the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone’s; nor could this have\r\nmade any difference to his position. He saw plainly enough that the old\r\nman wanted to exercise his power by tormenting him a little, and also\r\nprobably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms\r\nwith Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he saw to the bottom of his uncle\r\nFeatherstone’s soul, though in reality half what he saw there was no\r\nmore than the reflex of his own inclinations. The difficult task of\r\nknowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is\r\nchiefly made up of their own wishes.\r\n\r\nFred’s main point of debate with himself was, whether he should tell\r\nhis father, or try to get through the affair without his father’s\r\nknowledge. It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about him;\r\nand if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule’s report to Rosamond, it\r\nwould be sure to reach his father, who would as surely question him\r\nabout it. He said to Rosamond, as they slackened their pace—\r\n\r\n“Rosy, did Mary tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, she did.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That you were very unsteady.”\r\n\r\n“Was that all?”\r\n\r\n“I should think that was enough, Fred.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure she said no more?”\r\n\r\n“Mary mentioned nothing else. But really, Fred, I think you ought to be\r\nashamed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, fudge! Don’t lecture me. What did Mary say about it?”\r\n\r\n“I am not obliged to tell you. You care so very much what Mary says,\r\nand you are too rude to allow me to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I care what Mary says. She is the best girl I know.”\r\n\r\n“I should never have thought she was a girl to fall in love with.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never know.”\r\n\r\n“At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with her, for\r\nshe says she would not marry you if you asked her.”\r\n\r\n“She might have waited till I did ask her.”\r\n\r\n“I knew it would nettle you, Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. She would not have said so if you had not provoked her.”\r\nBefore reaching home, Fred concluded that he would tell the whole\r\naffair as simply as possible to his father, who might perhaps take on\r\nhimself the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\nOLD AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_.

Nay, tell me how you class your wealth of books\r\n    The drifted relics of all time.\r\n    As well sort them at once by size and livery:\r\n    Vellum, tall copies, and the common calf\r\n    Will hardly cover more diversity\r\n    Than all your labels cunningly devised\r\n    To class your unread authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to\r\nspeak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past\r\none, when he was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had\r\ncome in at one o’clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,\r\nthat there was little chance of the interview being over in half an\r\nhour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he\r\nused up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do\r\nnot imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired\r\nsort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,\r\nlight-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone\r\nan undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with\r\nopenness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not\r\nbe given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can\r\nbe shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr.\r\nBulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and an\r\napparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who\r\nthought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost\r\nimprovement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make no great\r\nfigure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them. If you are\r\nnot proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing\r\nyour guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look judicial. Such\r\njoys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode’s close\r\nattention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in\r\nMiddlemarch; it was attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by\r\nothers to his being Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them\r\nwished to know who his father and grandfather were, observing that\r\nfive-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in\r\nMiddlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate, the scrutinizing look was\r\na matter of indifference: he simply formed an unfavorable opinion of\r\nthe banker’s constitution, and concluded that he had an eager inward\r\nlife with little enjoyment of tangible things.\r\n\r\n“I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here\r\noccasionally, Mr. Lydgate,” the banker observed, after a brief pause.\r\n“If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable\r\ncoadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will\r\nbe many questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the\r\nnew hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have\r\nsaid about the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The\r\ndecision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the\r\nland and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his\r\npersonal attention to the object.”\r\n\r\n“There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like\r\nthis,” said Lydgate. “A fine fever hospital in addition to the old\r\ninfirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we\r\nget our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education\r\nthan the spread of such schools over the country? A born provincial man\r\nwho has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do what\r\nhe can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better than\r\ncommon towards London. Any valid professional aims may often find a\r\nfreer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.”\r\n\r\nOne of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet\r\ncapable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his\r\nordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of\r\nsuccess, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by\r\ncontempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no\r\nexperience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression\r\nof unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for\r\nthe difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked\r\nhim the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.\r\nOne can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a\r\nbetter man.\r\n\r\n“I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller opportunities,” Mr.\r\nBulstrode answered; “I mean, by confiding to you the superintendence of\r\nmy new hospital, should a maturer knowledge favor that issue, for I am\r\ndetermined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two\r\nphysicians. Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this\r\ntown as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to\r\nbe awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much withstood. With\r\nregard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I mean\r\nyour election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring a\r\ncertain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional brethren\r\nby presenting yourself as a reformer.”\r\n\r\n“I will not profess bravery,” said Lydgate, smiling, “but I acknowledge\r\na good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my\r\nprofession, if I did not believe that better methods were to be found\r\nand enforced there as well as everywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear sir,”\r\nsaid the banker. “I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,\r\nfor our medical men are most of them connected with respectable\r\ntownspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced me to give some\r\nattention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has\r\nplaced within our reach. I have consulted eminent men in the\r\nmetropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness under which\r\nmedical treatment labors in our provincial districts.”\r\n\r\n“Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be\r\nsatisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner. As to all the\r\nhigher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis—as\r\nto the philosophy of medical evidence—any glimmering of these can only\r\ncome from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have\r\nusually no more notion than the man in the moon.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which\r\nLydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his\r\ncomprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the\r\ntopic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful.\r\n\r\n“I am aware,” he said, “that the peculiar bias of medical ability is\r\ntowards material means. Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I hope we shall not\r\nvary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be\r\nactively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an\r\naid to me. You recognize, I hope; the existence of spiritual interests\r\nin your patients?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do. But those words are apt to cover different meanings to\r\ndifferent minds.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no\r\nteaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new\r\nregulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The building\r\nstands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?”\r\n\r\n“I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him. He\r\nseems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he is a\r\nnaturalist.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.\r\nI suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater\r\ntalents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.\r\n\r\n“I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in\r\nMiddlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.\r\n\r\n“What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,\r\n“is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital should be\r\nsuperseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and\r\nthat no other spiritual aid should be called in.”\r\n\r\n“As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew\r\nMr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he\r\nwas applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.\r\n\r\n“Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at\r\npresent. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled\r\nemphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of\r\nthe infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of\r\nthe cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,\r\nso far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n“I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said\r\nLydgate. “The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.”\r\n\r\n“My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me, indeed,\r\nthis question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my\r\nopponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for\r\ngratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore\r\ndrop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that\r\ntruth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this\r\nobject of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.\r\nLydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that\r\nnothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I\r\nhave another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will\r\nnot conceal it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said\r\nthe last words.\r\n\r\n“There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry that\r\nthe door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid\r\nsociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen\r\nRosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which\r\ntheir lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl\r\nwith pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.\r\nBefore he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had\r\nbeen “in no hurry about,” for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that\r\nshe thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a\r\nglass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.\r\n\r\n“I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,” said Mr.\r\nVincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,” he went on,\r\naccenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, “what I came here\r\nto talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred’s.”\r\n\r\n“That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as\r\ndifferent views as on diet, Vincy.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.)\r\n“The fact is, it’s about a whim of old Featherstone’s. Somebody has\r\nbeen cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to\r\ntry to set him against Fred. He’s very fond of Fred, and is likely to\r\ndo something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that\r\nhe means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as\r\nto the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely\r\nfrom worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family\r\nof three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting\r\nmoney to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in\r\ngiving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the\r\nconsequences.”\r\n\r\nTo point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely\r\nshrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient. When\r\na man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in the\r\ninterests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics\r\ngenerally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework\r\nof things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the\r\nbackground. And this particular reproof irritated him more than any\r\nother. It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was\r\nreaping the consequences. But he felt his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke;\r\nand though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from\r\nthat relief.\r\n\r\n“As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of your\r\npattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee everything\r\nin the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,\r\nand the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would\r\nhave done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took\r\nhim off: else he might have been a dean by this time. I think I was\r\njustified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it\r\nseems to me a man shouldn’t want to carve out his meat to an ounce\r\nbeforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous. It’s\r\na good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in my\r\nopinion, it’s a father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I\r\nsay that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of\r\nworldliness and inconsistent folly.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I never\r\nprofessed to be anything but worldly; and, what’s more, I don’t see\r\nanybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t conduct business\r\non what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is\r\nthat one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.”\r\n\r\n“This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,” said Mr. Bulstrode,\r\nwho, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in his chair, and\r\nshaded his eyes as if weary. “You had some more particular business.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old\r\nFeatherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing\r\nor trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you\r\nnever said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that\r\nFred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just a bit\r\nof a note saying you don’t believe a word of such stuff, either of his\r\nhaving borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool’s way. I suppose you\r\ncan have no objection to do that.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your son,\r\nin his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not\r\ntried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that\r\nsome one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a\r\npresumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other\r\nfolly in the world.”\r\n\r\n“But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the\r\npretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land. He is not a liar.\r\nI don’t want to make him better than he is. I have blown him up\r\nwell—nobody can say I wink at what he does. But he is not a liar. And I\r\nshould have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was no religion to\r\nhinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow, when you don’t\r\nknow worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of religion to put a\r\nspoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don’t believe such harm of\r\nhim as you’ve got no good reason to believe.”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by\r\nsmoothing his way to the future possession of Featherstone’s property.\r\nI cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it simply as a\r\nharvest for this world. You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,\r\nbut on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no\r\nmotive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you\r\nrefer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your\r\nson’s eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you\r\nexpect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to\r\nkeep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?”\r\n\r\n“If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and\r\nevangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that’s all\r\nI can say,” Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. “It may be for the glory\r\nof God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that\r\nPlymdale’s house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the\r\nBrassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that’s all I know about it.\r\nPerhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of\r\nGod, they might like it better. But I don’t mind so much about that—I\r\ncould get up a pretty row, if I chose.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered. “You pain me very\r\nmuch by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to understand\r\nmy grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for\r\nprinciples in the intricacies of the world—still less to make the\r\nthread clear for the careless and the scoffing. You must remember, if\r\nyou please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife’s\r\nbrother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as\r\nwithholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.\r\nI must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has\r\nenabled you to keep your place in the trade.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,” said Mr.\r\nVincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much retarded by\r\nprevious resolutions). “And when you married Harriet, I don’t see how\r\nyou could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail. If\r\nyou’ve changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the world,\r\nyou’d better say so. I’ve never changed; I’m a plain Churchman now,\r\njust as I used to be before doctrines came up. I take the world as I\r\nfind it, in trade and everything else. I’m contented to be no worse\r\nthan my neighbors. But if you want us to come down in the world, say\r\nso. I shall know better what to do then.”\r\n\r\n“You talk unreasonably. Shall you come down in the world for want of\r\nthis letter about your son?”\r\n\r\n“Well, whether or not, I consider it very unhandsome of you to refuse\r\nit. Such doings may be lined with religion, but outside they have a\r\nnasty, dog-in-the-manger look. You might as well slander Fred: it comes\r\npretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn’t set a slander\r\ngoing. It’s this sort of thing—this tyrannical spirit, wanting to play\r\nbishop and banker everywhere—it’s this sort of thing makes a man’s name\r\nstink.”\r\n\r\n“Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly\r\npainful to Harriet as well as myself,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with a\r\ntrifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to quarrel. It’s for my interest—and perhaps for yours\r\ntoo—that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think no worse\r\nof you than I do of other people. A man who half starves himself, and\r\ngoes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you do, believes in\r\nhis religion whatever it may be: you could turn over your capital just\r\nas fast with cursing and swearing:—plenty of fellows do. You like to be\r\nmaster, there’s no denying that; you must be first chop in heaven, else\r\nyou won’t like it much. But you’re my sister’s husband, and we ought to\r\nstick together; and if I know Harriet, she’ll consider it your fault if\r\nwe quarrel because you strain at a gnat in this way, and refuse to do\r\nFred a good turn. And I don’t mean to say I shall bear it well. I\r\nconsider it unhandsome.”\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy rose, began to button his great-coat, and looked steadily at\r\nhis brother-in-law, meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing\r\nMr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of\r\nhimself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer’s\r\nmind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and\r\nperhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would\r\nend. But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in\r\nthe rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of\r\nadmonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.\r\n\r\nIt was not in Mr. Bulstrode’s nature to comply directly in consequence\r\nof uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his course, he always\r\nneeded to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his\r\nhabitual standard. He said, at last—\r\n\r\n“I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to Harriet.\r\nI shall probably send you a letter.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be settled\r\nbefore I see you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n“Follows here the strict receipt\r\nFor that sauce to dainty meat,\r\nNamed Idleness, which many eat\r\nBy preference, and call it sweet:\r\n_First watch for morsels, like a hound\r\nMix well with buffets, stir them round\r\nWith good thick oil of flatteries, And froth with mean self-lauding\r\nlies.\r\nServe warm: the vessels you must choose\r\nTo keep it in are dead men’s shoes._”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect\r\ndesired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which\r\nFred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,\r\nand as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went\r\nup-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,\r\npropped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to\r\nenjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating\r\nmankind. He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his\r\nlips and drawing down their corners.\r\n\r\n“_Under the circumstances I will not decline to state my\r\nconviction_—tchah! what fine words the fellow puts! He’s as fine as an\r\nauctioneer—_that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of\r\nmoney on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone_—promised? who said I\r\nhad ever promised? I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I\r\nlike—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is\r\nunreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would\r\nattempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of\r\nsense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any\r\nreport of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any\r\nstatement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any\r\nproperty that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless\r\nmy heart! ‘property’—accrue—demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to him.\r\nHe couldn’t speak finer if he wanted to borrow. Well,” Mr. Featherstone\r\nhere looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed back the\r\nletter to him with a contemptuous gesture, “you don’t suppose I believe\r\na thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?”\r\n\r\nFred colored. “You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it\r\nvery likely that Mr. Bulstrode’s denial is as good as the authority\r\nwhich told you what he denies.”\r\n\r\n“Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now\r\nwhat d’ you expect?” said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his\r\nspectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.\r\n\r\n“I expect nothing, sir.” Fred with difficulty restrained himself from\r\nventing his irritation. “I came to bring you the letter. If you like I\r\nwill bid you good morning.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.”\r\n\r\nIt was a servant who came in answer to the bell.\r\n\r\n“Tell missy to come!” said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. “What\r\nbusiness had she to go away?” He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.\r\n\r\n“Why couldn’t you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my\r\nwaistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.”\r\n\r\nMary’s eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying. It was clear\r\nthat Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this\r\nmorning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the\r\nmuch-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to\r\nturn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good\r\nto be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she\r\nhad barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with\r\nthe expectation that something would be thrown at her. But she never\r\nhad anything worse than words to dread. When she went to reach the\r\nwaistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, “Allow me.”\r\n\r\n“Let it alone! You bring it, missy, and lay it down here,” said Mr.\r\nFeatherstone. “Now you go away again till I call you,” he added, when\r\nthe waistcoat was laid down by him. It was usual with him to season his\r\npleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially\r\ndisagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the\r\ncondiment. When his own relatives came she was treated better. Slowly\r\nhe took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he\r\ndrew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n“You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?” he said,\r\nlooking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present\r\nthe other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the\r\nmatter.” But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had\r\npresented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a\r\ncertain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him\r\nhighly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily conceive\r\nwhat—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time. And now that\r\nthe providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it would have\r\nbeen sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the\r\nneed: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of\r\nstrength to believe in a whole one.\r\n\r\nThe deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,\r\nlaying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,\r\nscorning to look eager. He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and\r\ndid not like courting an old fellow for his money. At last, Mr.\r\nFeatherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with\r\na little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but\r\nfive, as the less significant edges gaped towards him. But then, each\r\nmight mean fifty pounds. He took them, saying—\r\n\r\n“I am very much obliged to you, sir,” and was going to roll them up\r\nwithout seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.\r\nFeatherstone, who was eying him intently.\r\n\r\n“Come, don’t you think it worth your while to count ’em? You take money\r\nlike a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I\r\nshall be very happy to count them.”\r\n\r\nFred was not so happy, however, after he had counted them. For they\r\nactually presented the absurdity of being less than his hopefulness had\r\ndecided that they must be. What can the fitness of things mean, if not\r\ntheir fitness to a man’s expectations? Failing this, absurdity and\r\natheism gape behind him. The collapse for Fred was severe when he found\r\nthat he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher\r\neducation of this country did not seem to help him. Nevertheless he\r\nsaid, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—\r\n\r\n“It is very handsome of you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I should think it is,” said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and\r\nreplacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at\r\nlength, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,\r\nrepeating, “I should think it handsome.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,” said Fred, who had had time to\r\nrecover his cheerful air.\r\n\r\n“So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I\r\nreckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you’ve got to trust to.” Here\r\nthe old man’s eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the\r\nconsciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that\r\nthe smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have\r\nbeen more cramped than I have been,” said Fred, with some sense of\r\nsurprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with.\r\n“It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded\r\nhunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,\r\nable to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now. Eighty pound is enough\r\nfor that, I reckon—and you’ll have twenty pound over to get yourself\r\nout of any little scrape,” said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.\r\n\r\n“You are very good, sir,” said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast\r\nbetween the words and his feeling.\r\n\r\n“Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won’t\r\nget much out of his spekilations, I think. He’s got a pretty strong\r\nstring round your father’s leg, by what I hear, eh?”\r\n\r\n“My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he shows some sense there. But other people find ’em out without\r\nhis telling. _He’ll_ never have much to leave you: he’ll most-like die\r\nwithout a will—he’s the sort of man to do it—let ’em make him mayor of\r\nMiddlemarch as much as they like. But you won’t get much by his dying\r\nwithout a will, though you _are_ the eldest son.”\r\n\r\nFred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable\r\nbefore. True, he had never before given him quite so much money at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode’s, sir?” said Fred,\r\nrising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, I don’t want it. It’s worth no money to me.”\r\n\r\nFred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it\r\nwith much zest. He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little\r\nashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away\r\nimmediately after pocketing the money. Presently, the farm-bailiff came\r\nup to give his master a report, and Fred, to his unspeakable relief,\r\nwas dismissed with the injunction to come again soon.\r\n\r\nHe had longed not only to be set free from his uncle, but also to find\r\nMary Garth. She was now in her usual place by the fire, with sewing in\r\nher hands and a book open on the little table by her side. Her eyelids\r\nhad lost some of their redness now, and she had her usual air of\r\nself-command.\r\n\r\n“Am I wanted up-stairs?” she said, half rising as Fred entered.\r\n\r\n“No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.”\r\n\r\nMary sat down again, and resumed her work. She was certainly treating\r\nhim with more indifference than usual: she did not know how\r\naffectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs.\r\n\r\n“May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?”\r\n\r\n“Pray sit down,” said Mary; “you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.\r\nJohn Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my\r\nleave.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.”\r\n\r\n“I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in\r\na girl’s life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in\r\nlove coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom she\r\nis grateful. I should have thought that I, at least, might have been\r\nsafe from all that. I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of\r\nfancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.”\r\n\r\nMary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she\r\nended in a tremulous tone of vexation.\r\n\r\n“Confound John Waule! I did not mean to make you angry. I didn’t know\r\nyou had any reason for being grateful to me. I forgot what a great\r\nservice you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.” Fred also had\r\nhis pride, and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth\r\nthis outburst of Mary’s.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world. I do like to be\r\nspoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could\r\nunderstand a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who\r\nhave been to college.” Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a\r\nsuppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care how merry you are at my expense this morning,” said Fred,\r\n“I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you\r\nshould stay here to be bullied in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,\r\nand I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own\r\nway. I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is\r\npaid for, and never really doing it. Everything here I can do as well\r\nas any one else could; perhaps better than some—Rosy, for example.\r\nThough she is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned\r\nwith ogres in fairy tales.”\r\n\r\n“_Rosy!_” cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.\r\n\r\n“Come, Fred!” said Mary, emphatically; “you have no right to be so\r\ncritical.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean anything particular—just now?”\r\n\r\n“No, I mean something general—always.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that I am idle and extravagant. Well, I am not fit to be a poor\r\nman. I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.”\r\n\r\n“You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has\r\nnot pleased God to call you,” said Mary, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Well, I couldn’t do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do\r\nyours as a governess. You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,\r\nMary.”\r\n\r\n“I never said you ought to be a clergyman. There are other sorts of\r\nwork. It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and\r\nact accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“So I could, if—” Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the\r\nmantel-piece.\r\n\r\n“If you were sure you should not have a fortune?”\r\n\r\n“I did not say that. You want to quarrel with me. It is too bad of you\r\nto be guided by what other people say about me.”\r\n\r\n“How can I want to quarrel with you? I should be quarrelling with all\r\nmy new books,” said Mary, lifting the volume on the table. “However\r\nnaughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.”\r\n\r\n“Because I like you better than any one else. But I know you despise\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do—a little,” said Mary, nodding, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions\r\nabout everything.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I should.” Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly\r\nmistress of the situation. When a conversation has taken a wrong turn\r\nfor us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.\r\nThis was what Fred Vincy felt.\r\n\r\n“I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always\r\nknown—ever since she can remember; as a man often is. It is always some\r\nnew fellow who strikes a girl.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” said Mary, the corners of her mouth curling archly; “I\r\nmust go back on my experience. There is Juliet—she seems an example of\r\nwhat you say. But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long while;\r\nand Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they were\r\nchildren; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man; and\r\nMinna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a stranger.\r\nWaverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall in love\r\nwith him. And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and Corinne—they\r\nmay be said to have fallen in love with new men. Altogether, my\r\nexperience is rather mixed.”\r\n\r\nMary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was\r\nvery dear to him, though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows\r\nwhere observation sat laughingly. He was certainly an affectionate\r\nfellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with\r\nhis old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of\r\nthe country which had exalted his views of rank and income.\r\n\r\n“When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be\r\na better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being\r\nloved in return.”\r\n\r\n“Not of the least use in the world for him to say he _could_ be better.\r\nMight, could, would—they are contemptible auxiliaries.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how a man is to be good for much unless he has some one\r\nwoman to love him dearly.”\r\n\r\n“I think the goodness should come before he expects that.”\r\n\r\n“You know better, Mary. Women don’t love men for their goodness.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not. But if they love them, they never think them bad.”\r\n\r\n“It is hardly fair to say I am bad.”\r\n\r\n“I said nothing at all about you.”\r\n\r\n“I never shall be good for anything, Mary, if you will not say that you\r\nlove me—if you will not promise to marry me—I mean, when I am able to\r\nmarry.”\r\n\r\n“If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not\r\npromise ever to marry you.”\r\n\r\n“I think that is quite wicked, Mary. If you love me, you ought to\r\npromise to marry me.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if\r\nI did love you.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife. Of\r\ncourse: I am but three-and-twenty.”\r\n\r\n“In that last point you will alter. But I am not so sure of any other\r\nalteration. My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less,\r\nbe married.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am to blow my brains out?”\r\n\r\n“No; on the whole I should think you would do better to pass your\r\nexamination. I have heard Mr. Farebrother say it is disgracefully\r\neasy.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very fine. Anything is easy to him. Not that cleverness\r\nhas anything to do with it. I am ten times cleverer than many men who\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; “that accounts for\r\nthe curates like Mr. Crowse. Divide your cleverness by ten, and the\r\nquotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree. But that only shows you are\r\nten times more idle than the others.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if I did pass, you would not want me to go into the Church?”\r\n\r\n“That is not the question—what I want you to do. You have a conscience\r\nof your own, I suppose. There! there is Mr. Lydgate. I must go and tell\r\nmy uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Mary,” said Fred, seizing her hand as she rose; “if you will not give\r\nme some encouragement, I shall get worse instead of better.”\r\n\r\n“I will not give you any encouragement,” said Mary, reddening. “Your\r\nfriends would dislike it, and so would mine. My father would think it a\r\ndisgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not\r\nwork!”\r\n\r\nFred was stung, and released her hand. She walked to the door, but\r\nthere she turned and said: “Fred, you have always been so good, so\r\ngenerous to me. I am not ungrateful. But never speak to me in that way\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Fred, sulkily, taking up his hat and whip. His\r\ncomplexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a\r\nplucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a\r\nplain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone’s land in the\r\nbackground, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she would, she\r\nreally did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home, he gave four of the twenties to his mother, asking\r\nher to keep them for him. “I don’t want to spend that money, mother. I\r\nwant it to pay a debt with. So keep it safe away from my fingers.”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy. She doted on her eldest son and\r\nher youngest girl (a child of six), whom others thought her two\r\nnaughtiest children. The mother’s eyes are not always deceived in their\r\npartiality: she at least can best judge who is the tender,\r\nfilial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.\r\nPerhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him\r\nparticularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to\r\nspend the hundred pounds. For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred\r\nand sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by\r\nMary’s father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n“Black eyes you have left, you say,\r\n    Blue eyes fail to draw you;\r\nYet you seem more rapt to-day,\r\n    Than of old we saw you.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I track the fairest fair\r\n    Through new haunts of pleasure;\r\nFootprints here and echoes there\r\n    Guide me to my treasure:\r\n\r\n“Lo! she turns—immortal youth\r\n    Wrought to mortal stature,\r\nFresh as starlight’s aged truth—\r\n    Many-namèd Nature!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had the\r\nhappiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his\r\nplace among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is\r\nobserved to walk under, glories in his copious remarks and digressions\r\nas the least imitable part of his work, and especially in those initial\r\nchapters to the successive books of his history, where he seems to\r\nbring his armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty\r\nease of his fine English. But Fielding lived when the days were longer\r\n(for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer\r\nafternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter\r\nevenings. We belated historians must not linger after his example; and\r\nif we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as\r\nif delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so\r\nmuch to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were\r\nwoven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be\r\nconcentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that\r\ntempting range of relevancies called the universe.\r\n\r\nAt present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any\r\none interested in him than he could possibly be even to those who had\r\nseen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch. For surely all\r\nmust admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,\r\ncounted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as\r\na future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a\r\ncluster of signs for his neighbors’ false suppositions. There was a\r\ngeneral impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common\r\ncountry doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was\r\nsignificant of great things being expected from him. For everybody’s\r\nfamily doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have\r\nimmeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish\r\nor vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher\r\nintuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable conviction, and\r\nwas unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were\r\nopposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in\r\nWrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding Toller and “the\r\nlowering system” as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious\r\nbleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of\r\nthorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad\r\nname, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for example,\r\nit were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with\r\nblank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The strengtheners\r\nand the lowerers were all “clever” men in somebody’s opinion, which is\r\nreally as much as can be said for any living talents. Nobody’s\r\nimagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could\r\nknow as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians, who\r\nalone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the\r\nsmallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general\r\nimpression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any\r\ngeneral practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He was but\r\nseven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common—at\r\nwhich they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking\r\nthat Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their\r\nbacks, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him,\r\nshall draw their chariot.\r\n\r\nHe had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school. His\r\nfather, a military man, had made but little provision for three\r\nchildren, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,\r\nit seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing\r\nhim to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score\r\nof family dignity. He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided\r\nbent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life\r\nwhich they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their\r\nfathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember\r\nsome morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down\r\nan untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker,\r\nor for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the\r\nfirst traceable beginning of our love. Something of that sort happened\r\nto Lydgate. He was a quick fellow, and when hot from play, would toss\r\nhimself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep in any sort of book\r\nthat he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas or Gulliver, so\r\nmuch the better, but Bailey’s Dictionary would do, or the Bible with\r\nthe Apocrypha in it. Something he must read, when he was not riding the\r\npony, or running and hunting, or listening to the talk of men. All this\r\nwas true of him at ten years of age; he had then read through “Chrysal,\r\nor the Adventures of a Guinea,” which was neither milk for babes, nor\r\nany chalky mixture meant to pass for milk, and it had already occurred\r\nto him that books were stuff, and that life was stupid. His school\r\nstudies had not much modified that opinion, for though he “did” his\r\nclassics and mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in them. It was said\r\nof him, that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but he had certainly\r\nnot yet liked to do anything remarkable. He was a vigorous animal with\r\na ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an\r\nintellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial\r\naffair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders,\r\nhe had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.\r\nProbably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at\r\nthat period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions which have not\r\nyet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to the small home\r\nlibrary to hunt once more for a book which might have some freshness\r\nfor him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty row of volumes\r\nwith gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of an old\r\nCyclopaedia which he had never disturbed. It would at least be a\r\nnovelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he stood\r\non a chair to get them down. But he opened the volume which he first\r\ntook from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift\r\nattitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he\r\nopened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that\r\ndrew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. He was not much\r\nacquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were\r\nfolding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling\r\nhim with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the\r\nhuman frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read\r\nthe indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general\r\nsense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal\r\nstructure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for\r\nanything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he\r\nhad no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated\r\nthan how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had\r\ncome, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to\r\nhim by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces\r\nplanked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed\r\nto be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an\r\nintellectual passion.\r\n\r\nWe are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to\r\nfall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be fatally\r\nparted from her. Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we\r\nare never weary of describing what King James called a woman’s “makdom\r\nand her fairnesse,” never weary of listening to the twanging of the old\r\nTroubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other\r\nkind of “makdom and fairnesse” which must be wooed with industrious\r\nthought and patient renunciation of small desires? In the story of this\r\npassion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious\r\nmarriage, sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the\r\ncatastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the\r\nTroubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their\r\nvocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as\r\nthe tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant\r\nto shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story of\r\ntheir coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the\r\ngross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps\r\ntheir ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the\r\nardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked\r\nlike a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.\r\nNothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual\r\nchange! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may\r\nhave sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered\r\nour conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it\r\ncame with the vibrations from a woman’s glance.\r\n\r\nLydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the\r\nbetter hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form\r\nof a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his\r\nbread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift\r\ncalled his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,\r\nEdinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it\r\nmight be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect\r\ninterchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance\r\nbetween intellectual conquest and the social good. Lydgate’s nature\r\ndemanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a\r\nflesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the\r\nabstractions of special study. He cared not only for “cases,” but for\r\nJohn and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThere was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and\r\ngave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its\r\nvenal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine\r\nthough undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the\r\ndetermination that when he came home again he would settle in some\r\nprovincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational\r\nseverance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his\r\nown scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would\r\nkeep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social\r\ntruckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by\r\nthe independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this\r\nwas a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great\r\nefforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to\r\nexclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and\r\nappointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were\r\npromoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over\r\nlarge areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the\r\npublic mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar\r\nsanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction\r\nobtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery\r\nfrom having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice\r\nchiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred\r\nthat it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only\r\nbe got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic\r\nprescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.\r\nConsidering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to\r\nthe number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist\r\nin the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the\r\nunits was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be\r\na unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that\r\nspreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the\r\naverages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an\r\nadvantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did\r\nnot simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He\r\nwas ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that\r\nhe might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link\r\nin the chain of discovery.\r\n\r\nDoes it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream\r\nof himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know little of the\r\ngreat originators until they have been lifted up among the\r\nconstellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for\r\nexample, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did he not once play a\r\nprovincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling pianists?\r\nEach of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who\r\nperhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything\r\nwhich was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his\r\nlittle local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and\r\nsordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards\r\nfinal companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the\r\ndangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his\r\nresolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he\r\nfelt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his vanities\r\nprovoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital,\r\nbut to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of\r\na great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice\r\nof his profession. There was fascination in the hope that the two\r\npurposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and\r\ninference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his\r\njudgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument\r\nof larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his\r\nprofession? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very\r\nmeans keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On one\r\npoint he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his\r\ncareer: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make\r\na profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are\r\nexposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may\r\nhave leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to\r\nbegin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite\r\ncertainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the\r\ndemonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to\r\nact stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply\r\nprescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from\r\ndruggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the\r\nstyle of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as\r\noffensive criticism by his professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to\r\ninnovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the\r\nbest security for his practising honestly according to his belief was\r\nto get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than\r\nthe present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when\r\nAmerica was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he\r\nwere wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark\r\nterritories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young\r\nadventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards\r\nenlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he\r\nbecame interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature\r\nof fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that\r\nfundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the\r\ncentury had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of\r\nBichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another\r\nAlexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great\r\nFrenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies,\r\nfundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be\r\nunderstood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;\r\nbut must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,\r\nout of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are\r\ncompacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in\r\nvarious proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,\r\neach material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man,\r\none sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its\r\nparts—what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the\r\nnature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with\r\nhis detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on\r\nmedical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,\r\noil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of\r\nstructure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms\r\nof maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on\r\nhuman conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of\r\n1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the\r\nold paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might\r\nhave seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s. This great seer did\r\nnot go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the\r\nliving organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was\r\nopen to another mind to say, have not these structures some common\r\nbasis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,\r\nsatin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as\r\nof oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all\r\nformer explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already\r\nvibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was\r\nenamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of\r\nliving structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately\r\nafter the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared\r\nfor those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive\r\ntissue? In that way Lydgate put the question—not quite in the way\r\nrequired by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word\r\nbefalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be\r\nwatchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation—on many\r\nhints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but\r\nof the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new\r\nenthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate’s plan of his future: to do\r\ngood small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,\r\nwithout any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action\r\nshould be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life\r\ninteresting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic\r\nrites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him\r\nafter buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying\r\nfor. He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine\r\nsubject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that\r\namusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an\r\narduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of\r\ncircumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims\r\nand makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain\r\neven with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is\r\na process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much as\r\nthe Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both\r\nvirtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will\r\nnot, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.\r\nAmong our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little\r\ntoo self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little\r\nspotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant\r\nthere with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to\r\nlapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient\r\nsolicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but\r\nthen, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,\r\nand would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The\r\nparticular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled\r\nhave distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;\r\nfilling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our\r\nnoses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in\r\ncorrespondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us\r\ndiffers from another. Lydgate’s conceit was of the arrogant sort, never\r\nsimpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and\r\nbenevolently contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being\r\nsorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power\r\nover him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in\r\nParis, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All\r\nhis faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who\r\nhad a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in\r\nhis ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay\r\nthe spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless\r\ngrace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so\r\nambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views\r\nof social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius\r\nif you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has\r\nthe best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in\r\nimagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music,\r\nor the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of\r\ncommonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of\r\nnoble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in\r\nordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to\r\nhis intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment\r\nabout furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known\r\n(without his telling) that he was better born than other country\r\nsurgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but\r\nwhenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes\r\nof reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there\r\nwould be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best.\r\n\r\nAs to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous\r\nfolly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant\r\nperiod would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be\r\nacquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of\r\nimpetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving\r\nof passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness\r\nwhich helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be told without\r\nmany words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the\r\ntime when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some\r\ngalvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and\r\nnot being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and\r\nrabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation\r\nof unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of\r\nthe Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had\r\nalready seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the\r\ncollaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her\r\nlover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate\r\nwas in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he\r\nnever expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a\r\nGreek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty\r\nwhich carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a\r\nsoft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous\r\nreputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It\r\nwas her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public\r\nwas satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this\r\nwoman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the\r\nsweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his\r\ngalvanism, to which he would presently return. But this evening the old\r\ndrama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act\r\nthe stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife\r\nveritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek\r\npierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a\r\nswoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this\r\ntime. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage,\r\nand was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by\r\nfinding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.\r\nParis rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder? Some of the\r\nactress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and\r\nliked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but\r\nLydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her\r\ninnocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he\r\nhad felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender\r\nthought of her lot. The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was\r\ndiscoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other;\r\nand it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should\r\nhave brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in\r\nMadame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews\r\nwith her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked little; but\r\nthat was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed grateful;\r\nher presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was\r\nmadly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than\r\nhimself should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of\r\nreopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would\r\nhave been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris\r\nwithout warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one\r\ncarried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come\r\nto a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by\r\never-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful\r\ncomforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as\r\nsome other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered\r\nindications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at\r\nlast acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking\r\nmore majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her\r\narms. He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual\r\nquietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and\r\nobtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling\r\nher that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that\r\nthis was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his\r\nhabitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved\r\nto do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to\r\naccommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that\r\nsome of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations,\r\nand even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our\r\npersistent self pauses and awaits us.\r\n\r\nTo have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially\r\ntender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the\r\nnext day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with\r\neyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.\r\n“Are all Englishmen like that?”\r\n\r\n“I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are\r\nlonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,\r\nbut I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”\r\n\r\nLaure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under\r\nher grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt\r\nclose to her knees.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her\r\narms folded. “My foot really slipped.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal\r\naccident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”\r\n\r\nAgain Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “_I meant to do\r\nit._”\r\n\r\nLydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed\r\nto pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.\r\n\r\n“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently. “He was\r\nbrutal to you: you hated him.”\r\n\r\n“No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in\r\nmy country; that was not agreeable to me.”\r\n\r\n“Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you planned to\r\nmurder him?”\r\n\r\n“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”\r\n\r\nLydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he\r\nlooked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his\r\nyoung adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.\r\n\r\n“You are a good young man,” she said. “But I do not like husbands. I\r\nwill never have another.”\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris\r\nchambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him. He was saved\r\nfrom hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his\r\nbelief that human life might be made better. But he had more reason\r\nthan ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced;\r\nand henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman,\r\nentertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand.\r\n\r\nNo one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate’s\r\npast as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable\r\ntownsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager\r\nattempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did\r\nnot come under their own senses. Not only young virgins of that town,\r\nbut gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new\r\nacquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very\r\nvague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for\r\nthat instrumentality. Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing\r\nLydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n“All that in woman is adored\r\n    In thy fair self I find—\r\nFor the whole sex can but afford\r\n    The handsome and the kind.”\r\n—SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain\r\nto the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and\r\nLydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power\r\nexercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a\r\nruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters\r\nthere were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a\r\ncompromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general\r\nscheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you\r\nto hold a candle to the devil.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker,\r\nwho knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could\r\ntouch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence\r\nthat was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and\r\nsevere in watching the result. He had gathered, as an industrious man\r\nalways at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,\r\nand his private charities were both minute and abundant. He would take\r\na great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and\r\nhe would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype\r\nthe washerwoman against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her\r\ndrying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.\r\nStrype. His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire\r\nstrictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a\r\nman gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as\r\ngratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,\r\npropagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external\r\nmeans. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as\r\npossible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went through a\r\ngreat deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust\r\nhis motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required. But,\r\nas we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. There\r\nwere many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only\r\nweigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since\r\nMr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and\r\ndrinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything,\r\nhe must have a sort of vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when Lydgate\r\nwas dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,\r\nhe observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the\r\nhost himself, though his reasons against the proposed arrangement\r\nturned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all\r\ndoctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were\r\nfree from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the\r\nchaplain’s having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who\r\nwas as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher\r\nanywhere, and companionable too.\r\n\r\n“What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a\r\ngreat coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m precious glad I’m not one of the Directors now. I shall vote\r\nfor referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board\r\ntogether. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders,\r\nDoctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior\r\nphysician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite. “You\r\nmedical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will\r\nprescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”\r\n\r\n“I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general, appointments\r\nare apt to be made too much a question of personal liking. The fittest\r\nman for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most\r\nagreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way\r\nwould be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and\r\nput them out of the question.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,” though\r\nDr. Minchin was usually said to have more “penetration,” divested his\r\nlarge heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while\r\nLydgate was speaking. Whatever was not problematical and suspected\r\nabout this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign\r\nideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and\r\nforgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose\r\nstanding had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on\r\nMeningitis, of which at least one copy marked “own” was bound in calf.\r\nFor my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s\r\nself-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very\r\nunpleasant to find deprecated.\r\n\r\nLydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company. Mr.\r\nVincy said, that if he could have _his_ way, he would not put\r\ndisagreeable fellows anywhere.\r\n\r\n“Hang your reforms!” said Mr. Chichely. “There’s no greater humbug in\r\nthe world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some trick to put\r\nin new men. I hope you are not one of the ‘Lancet’s’ men, Mr.\r\nLydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal\r\nprofession: your words appear to point that way.”\r\n\r\n“I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more: he is\r\nan ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of\r\nthe profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,\r\nfor the sake of getting some notoriety for himself. There are men who\r\ndon’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.\r\nBut Wakley is right sometimes,” the Doctor added, judicially. “I could\r\nmention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up in favor\r\nof his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a\r\ncoroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?”\r\n\r\n“In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man more\r\nincompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind. People\r\ntalk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a\r\nblind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular\r\nsubject, unless he knows that subject well. A lawyer is no better than\r\nan old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he to know the action\r\nof a poison? You might as well say that scanning verse will teach you\r\nto scan the potato crops.”\r\n\r\n“You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner’s business to\r\nconduct the _post-mortem_, but only to take the evidence of the medical\r\nwitness?” said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.\r\n\r\n“Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said Lydgate.\r\n“Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance\r\nof decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to\r\nbe a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the\r\nstomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.”\r\n\r\nLydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his\r\nMajesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question, “Don’t you\r\nagree with me, Dr. Sprague?”\r\n\r\n“To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the\r\nmetropolis,” said the Doctor. “But I hope it will be long before this\r\npart of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even\r\nthough it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him. I am\r\nsure Vincy will agree with me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,” said Mr.\r\nVincy, jovially. “And in my opinion, you’re safest with a lawyer.\r\nNobody can know everything. Most things are ‘visitation of God.’ And as\r\nto poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we\r\njoin the ladies?”\r\n\r\nLydgate’s private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very\r\ncoroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he had not\r\nmeant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of moving in\r\ngood Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a\r\nqualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a\r\nprig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;\r\nespecially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself\r\neminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a\r\n_tête-à-tête_, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She\r\nresigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s\r\nblooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating\r\nfrom her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,\r\nwas certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy\r\nhouse—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the\r\ndaughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs.\r\nVincy gave more effect to Rosamond’s refinement, which was beyond what\r\nLydgate had expected.\r\n\r\nCertainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression\r\nof refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly\r\nright when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.\r\nAnd Rosamond could say the right thing; for she was clever with that\r\nsort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.\r\nHappily she never attempted to joke, and this perhaps was the most\r\ndecisive mark of her cleverness.\r\n\r\nShe and Lydgate readily got into conversation. He regretted that he had\r\nnot heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure he\r\nallowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go\r\nand hear music.\r\n\r\n“You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n“No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;\r\nbut the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion about,\r\ndelights me—affects me. How stupid the world is that it does not make\r\nmore use of such a pleasure within its reach!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly any\r\ngood musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,\r\nleaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped on a\r\ndrum?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her rare\r\nsmiles. “But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,\r\nin thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be\r\nmade out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if\r\nthe petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;\r\nand yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,\r\nself-possessed grace. Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had\r\nlost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer\r\nattracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. But he recalled\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond. “Papa is\r\nsure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have\r\nheard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only\r\nonce been to London. But our organist at St. Peter’s is a good\r\nmusician, and I go on studying with him.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what you saw in London.”\r\n\r\n“Very little.” (A more naive girl would have said, “Oh, everything!”\r\nBut Rosamond knew better.) “A few of the ordinary sights, such as raw\r\ncountry girls are always taken to.”\r\n\r\n“Do you call yourself a raw country girl?” said Lydgate, looking at her\r\nwith an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush\r\nwith pleasure. But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a\r\nlittle, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an\r\nhabitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten’s paw.\r\nNot that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph\r\ncaught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon’s.\r\n\r\n“I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at\r\nMiddlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I am\r\nreally afraid of you.”\r\n\r\n“An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her\r\nknowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a\r\nthousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were\r\nany common language between them. Happily, there is a common language\r\nbetween women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him from\r\njarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other side of\r\nthe room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father’s desire,\r\nthat Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically\r\nperforming “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men who have passed their\r\nexaminations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n“Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.\r\nLydgate ill,” said Rosamond. “He has an ear.”\r\n\r\nFred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.\r\n\r\nRosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, “You perceive,\r\nthe bears will not always be taught.”\r\n\r\n“Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it\r\nupward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. “Some good\r\nrousing tunes first.”\r\n\r\nRosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school (close to\r\na county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church\r\nand castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be\r\nfound in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted\r\nKapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of\r\nmusical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s instinct, had seized\r\nhis manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble\r\nmusic with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard for\r\nthe first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from\r\nRosamond’s fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in\r\nperpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an\r\noriginating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was\r\ntaken possession of, and began to believe in her as something\r\nexceptional. After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find\r\nthe rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently\r\nunfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that\r\nare not obvious. He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any\r\ncompliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was\r\ndeepened.\r\n\r\nHer singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to\r\nhear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang “Meet me by\r\nmoonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must share the\r\nfashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always\r\nclassical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan” with effect,\r\nor Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti, batti”—she only\r\nwanted to know what her audience liked.\r\n\r\nHer father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.\r\nHer mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest\r\nlittle girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s hand up and down in\r\ntime to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism\r\nabout Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he\r\ncould do the same thing on his flute. It was the pleasantest family\r\nparty that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys\r\nhad the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the\r\nbelief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most\r\ncounty towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain\r\nsuspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived\r\nin the provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the\r\ncard-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly\r\nimpatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a\r\nhandsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose\r\nblack was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray\r\neyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little\r\nLouisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by\r\nMiss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to\r\ncondense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the\r\nevening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come\r\nand see him. “I can’t let you off, you know, because I have some\r\nbeetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man\r\ntill he has seen all we have to show him.”\r\n\r\nBut soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,\r\n“Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too\r\nyoung and light for this kind of thing.”\r\n\r\nLydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so\r\npainful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in\r\nthis certainly not erudite household. He could half understand it: the\r\ngood-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for\r\npassing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the\r\nhouse beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nEverything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was\r\nbrown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,\r\njust the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay\r\nmany such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;\r\nand now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to\r\nexcuse himself and go.\r\n\r\n“You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said, when the\r\nwhist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you have been used\r\nto something quite different.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said Lydgate. “But\r\nI have noticed that one always believes one’s own town to be more\r\nstupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it\r\ncomes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the same\r\nway. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much greater\r\nthan I had expected.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased\r\nwith those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.\r\n\r\n“No, I mean something much nearer to me.”\r\n\r\nRosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you care\r\nabout dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever\r\ndance.”\r\n\r\n“I would dance with you if you would allow me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. “I was only going\r\nto say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you\r\nwould feel insulted if you were asked to come.”\r\n\r\n“Not on the condition I mentioned.”\r\n\r\nAfter this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving\r\ntowards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.\r\nFarebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a\r\nstriking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock supper was\r\nbrought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was\r\npunch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He was\r\nwinning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers\r\nshould end, and Lydgate at last took his leave.\r\n\r\nBut as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air\r\ntowards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church, which\r\nstood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the\r\noldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage\r\nworth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he\r\nwondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at\r\ncards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may\r\nhave his good reasons.” Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it\r\nshould turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. “What is\r\nhis religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along\r\nwith it? One must use such brains as are to be found.”\r\n\r\nThese were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked away from\r\nMr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider\r\nhim hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of Rosamond and her\r\nmusic only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he\r\ndwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no\r\nagitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.\r\nHe could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and\r\ntherefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love\r\nwith a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond\r\nexceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was\r\nnot, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.\r\nCertainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would\r\nhave been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just\r\nthe kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined,\r\ndocile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and\r\nenshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration\r\nthat excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt sure that if\r\never he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that\r\ndistinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music,\r\nthat sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being\r\nmoulded only for pure and delicate joys.\r\n\r\nBut since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more\r\npressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he\r\nwas specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and\r\nhad followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the\r\nspecific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far\r\ninto the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details\r\nand relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it\r\nnecessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these\r\nbeing subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature,\r\nand that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial\r\nconversation of men. Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him\r\nthat delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere\r\narbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and\r\nconstructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest\r\nobedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with\r\nimpartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its\r\nown work.\r\n\r\nMany men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of\r\ntheir profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of\r\nvery poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming\r\ndown on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat’s wings and spurts\r\nof phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect\r\nlife in a diseased dream. But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate\r\nregarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that\r\nreveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in\r\nthat outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the\r\ninward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing\r\neven the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space. He for his\r\npart had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself\r\nable and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is\r\nthe very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and\r\ncorrecting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to\r\npierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human\r\nmisery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first\r\nlurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and\r\ntransition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nAs he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the\r\ngrate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable\r\nafterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a\r\nspecific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the\r\nrest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back\r\nafter vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted\r\nstrength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and\r\nsomething like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n“If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,” he thought, “I might\r\nhave got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always\r\nin blinkers. I should never have been happy in any profession that did\r\nnot call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good\r\nwarm contact with my neighbors. There is nothing like the medical\r\nprofession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that\r\ntouches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too. It\r\nis rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.”\r\n\r\nThis last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the\r\nevening. They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as he took up\r\nhis bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is\r\napt to accompany agreeable recollections. He was an ardent fellow, but\r\nat present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the\r\nambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life\r\nof mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure\r\ncountry practice to begin with.\r\n\r\nPoor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each lived in a world of\r\nwhich the other knew nothing. It had not occurred to Lydgate that he\r\nhad been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any\r\nreason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any\r\npathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit,\r\nthat inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a\r\nlarge part in the lives of most girls. He had not meant to look at her\r\nor speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and\r\ncompliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed\r\nto him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for\r\nhe feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise\r\nat her possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered\r\nevery look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a\r\npreconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen\r\ndevelopment and climax. In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to\r\nimagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious\r\nbusiness in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever,\r\nas well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate\r\nwas his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch\r\nadmirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and\r\ngetting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which\r\nshe would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last\r\nassociate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked\r\ndown on the Middlemarchers. It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to\r\ndiscern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had\r\nseen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,\r\nand seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding\r\ntheir plain dress.\r\n\r\nIf you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family\r\ncould cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the\r\nsense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power\r\nof comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth\r\nand epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. Our passions do\r\nnot live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe\r\nof notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together,\r\nfeeding out of the common store according to their appetite.\r\n\r\nRosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius\r\nLydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was\r\nexcusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men\r\nmight, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe\r\nat once that Lydgate could be no exception. His looks and words meant\r\nmore to her than other men’s, because she cared more for them: she\r\nthought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection\r\nof appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which\r\nwould find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been\r\nconscious of.\r\n\r\nFor Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was disagreeable\r\nto her, was industrious; and now more than ever she was active in\r\nsketching her landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in\r\npractising her music, and in being from morning till night her own\r\nstandard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her own\r\nconsciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more\r\nvariable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house. She\r\nfound time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and\r\nshe knew much poetry by heart. Her favorite poem was “Lalla Rookh.”\r\n\r\n“The best girl in the world! He will be a happy fellow who gets her!”\r\nwas the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and\r\nthe rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in\r\ncountry towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. But\r\nMrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous\r\npitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid\r\naside as soon as she was married? While her aunt Bulstrode, who had a\r\nsisterly faithfulness towards her brother’s family, had two sincere\r\nwishes for Rosamond—that she might show a more serious turn of mind,\r\nand that she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n“The clerkly person smiled and said\r\nPromise was a pretty maid,\r\nBut being poor she died unwed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,\r\nlived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match\r\nthe church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house\r\nwas old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father\r\nand grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding and\r\nwreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it.\r\nThere were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated\r\nlawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect\r\nthem, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling\r\na prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the\r\ndark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which\r\nLydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were\r\nalso old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs.\r\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed\r\nwith dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy;\r\nMiss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills\r\nand kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred\r\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s elder sister, well-looking like himself, but\r\nnipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives\r\nin uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected\r\nto see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a\r\nbachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the\r\nchief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural\r\nobjects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as\r\nmost men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first\r\ntime in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial\r\nparts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This\r\nwas not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a trifle milder and\r\nmore silent, the chief talker being his mother, while he only put in a\r\ngood-humored moderating remark here and there. The old lady was\r\nevidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think, and\r\nto regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was\r\nafforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants\r\nattended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her\r\narm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she\r\nhad first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round\r\nfurtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent\r\nnoise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble.\r\nThat basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined\r\nfor the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine\r\nmornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so\r\nspontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had\r\nbeen a pleasant vice that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was\r\nconscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she\r\nmight give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the\r\nguilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of\r\ngiving!\r\n\r\nMrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and\r\nprecision. She presently informed him that they were not often in want\r\nof medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children to wear\r\nflannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered\r\nthe chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those\r\nwhose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.\r\nFarebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just\r\nthan that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors\r\nought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers\r\nand mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. There was\r\nno need to go back on what you couldn’t see.\r\n\r\n“My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she objects\r\nto metaphysics.”\r\n\r\n“I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few plain\r\ntruths, and make everything square with them. When I was young, Mr.\r\nLydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong. We knew\r\nour catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.\r\nEvery respectable Church person had the same opinions. But now, if you\r\nspeak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be\r\ncontradicted.”\r\n\r\n“That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain\r\ntheir own point,” said Lydgate.\r\n\r\n“But my mother always gives way,” said the Vicar, slyly.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about\r\n_me_. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what\r\nthey taught me. Any one may see what comes of turning. If you change\r\nonce, why not twenty times?”\r\n\r\n“A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for\r\nchanging again,” said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, they are never wanting,\r\nwhen a man has no constancy of mind. My father never changed, and he\r\npreached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few\r\nbetter. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get\r\nyou a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That’s my opinion,\r\nand I think anybody’s stomach will bear me out.”\r\n\r\n“About the dinner certainly, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly seventy, Mr.\r\nLydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to follow new\r\nlights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they\r\ncame in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was\r\nnot so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you\r\nmight be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may\r\nbe no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on\r\npretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am\r\nproud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in\r\nthis kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to\r\ngo by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”\r\n\r\n“A mother is never partial,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling. “What do\r\nyou think Tyke’s mother says about him?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness\r\nblunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments. “She\r\nsays the truth to herself, depend upon it.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing bad at all,” said Mr. Farebrother. “He is a zealous\r\nfellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I don’t\r\nagree with him.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me only\r\nto-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came\r\nto hear you preach.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after\r\nher small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to\r\nsay “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things! poor things!” in\r\nreference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But the\r\nVicar answered quietly—\r\n\r\n“That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think my\r\nsermons are worth a load of coals to them.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, “you\r\ndon’t know my son: he always undervalues himself. I tell him he is\r\nundervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most excellent\r\npreacher.”\r\n\r\n“That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,\r\nmother,” said the Vicar, laughing. “I promised to show you my\r\ncollection,” he added, turning to Lydgate; “shall we go?”\r\n\r\nAll three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away\r\nwithout being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred had\r\nabundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden in such haste to take\r\na visitor to his den? There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers\r\nfull of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor. Mr.\r\nLydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage would be far better. In\r\nshort, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as\r\nthe king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much\r\nneed of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a young\r\nbachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better.\r\n\r\n“My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest\r\nin my hobbies,” said the Vicar, as he opened the door of his study,\r\nwhich was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had\r\nimplied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\n“Men of your profession don’t generally smoke,” he said. Lydgate smiled\r\nand shook his head. “Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose. You will\r\nhear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company. They don’t\r\nknow how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative. I am\r\nheavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush into idleness, and\r\nstagnate there with all my might.”\r\n\r\n“And you mean to give it all to your work. I am some ten or twelve\r\nyears older than you, and have come to a compromise. I feed a weakness\r\nor two lest they should get clamorous. See,” continued the Vicar,\r\nopening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an exhaustive study\r\nof the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna\r\nand flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly\r\nrich in orthoptera: I don’t know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that\r\nglass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don’t\r\nreally care about these things?”\r\n\r\n“Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had\r\ntime to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an\r\ninterest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my\r\nprofession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel\r\nand beginning to fill his pipe. “You don’t know what it is to want\r\nspiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a\r\nvariety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of\r\nPhilomicron, for the ‘Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a learned treatise on\r\nthe entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not\r\nmentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage\r\nthrough the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,\r\nshowing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern\r\nresearch. You don’t mind my fumigating you?”\r\n\r\nLydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its\r\nimplied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right\r\nvocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase\r\nfilled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made him\r\nthink again of the winnings at cards and their destination. But he was\r\nbeginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that\r\nMr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The Vicar’s frankness\r\nseemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy\r\nconsciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply\r\nthe relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible.\r\nApparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might\r\nseem premature, for he presently said—\r\n\r\n“I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,\r\nand know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley who shared\r\nyour apartment at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his,\r\nand he told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you\r\nfirst came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found\r\nthat you were. Only I don’t forget that you have not had the like\r\nprologue about me.”\r\n\r\nLydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half\r\nunderstand it. “By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley? I\r\nhave quite lost sight of him. He was hot on the French social systems,\r\nand talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean\r\ncommunity. Is he gone?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich\r\npatient.”\r\n\r\n“Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a short\r\nscornful laugh. “He would have it, the medical profession was an\r\ninevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the men—men who\r\ntruckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against humbug outside\r\nthe walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus\r\nwithin. In short—I am reporting my own conversation—you may be sure I\r\nhad all the good sense on my side.”\r\n\r\n“Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the\r\nPythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam in\r\nyourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the\r\noriginal Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have paid\r\ntwelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of\r\ndifficulties. But”—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then added,\r\n“you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an exchange?\r\nYou shall not have it without a fair barter.”\r\n\r\n“I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits. And I will throw in\r\nRobert Brown’s new thing—‘Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of\r\nPlants’—if you don’t happen to have it already.”\r\n\r\n“Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher price.\r\nSuppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about\r\nall my new species?” The Vicar, while he talked in this way,\r\nalternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth, and returned to\r\nhang rather fondly over his drawers. “That would be good discipline,\r\nyou know, for a young doctor who has to please his patients in\r\nMiddlemarch. You must learn to be bored, remember. However, you shall\r\nhave the monster on your own terms.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody’s\r\nnonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?” said\r\nLydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother’s side, and looking rather absently\r\nat the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in\r\nexquisite writing. “The shortest way is to make your value felt, so\r\nthat people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the value, and\r\nyou must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do that. Either\r\nyou slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you\r\nwear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.\r\nBut do look at these delicate orthoptera!”\r\n\r\nLydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar\r\nlaughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.\r\n\r\n“Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,” Lydgate began, after\r\nthey had sat down, “I made up my mind some time ago to do with as\r\nlittle of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything\r\nin London, for a good many years at least. I didn’t like what I saw\r\nwhen I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive\r\ntrickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and\r\nare less of companions, but for that reason they affect one’s\r\namour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one’s own\r\ncourse more quietly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,\r\nthe work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people miss that, and\r\nrepent too late. But you must not be too sure of keeping your\r\nindependence.”\r\n\r\n“You mean of family ties?” said Lydgate, conceiving that these might\r\npress rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“Not altogether. Of course they make many things more difficult. But a\r\ngood wife—a good unworldly woman—may really help a man, and keep him\r\nmore independent. There’s a parishioner of mine—a fine fellow, but who\r\nwould hardly have pulled through as he has done without his wife. Do\r\nyou know the Garths? I think they were not Peacock’s patients.”\r\n\r\n“No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone’s, at Lowick.”\r\n\r\n“Their daughter: an excellent girl.”\r\n\r\n“She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.”\r\n\r\n“She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Lydgate; he could hardly say “Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she gauges everybody. I prepared her for confirmation—she is a\r\nfavorite of mine.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to\r\nknow more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down his pipe,\r\nstretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards\r\nLydgate, saying—\r\n\r\n“But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We have\r\nour intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and\r\nBulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.”\r\n\r\n“What is there against Bulstrode?” said Lydgate, emphatically.\r\n\r\n“I did not say there was anything against him except that. If you vote\r\nagainst him you will make him your enemy.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I need mind about that,” said Lydgate, rather\r\nproudly; “but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he\r\nspends large sums on useful public objects. He might help me a good\r\ndeal in carrying out my ideas. As to his religious notions—why, as\r\nVoltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if\r\nadministered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man who\r\nwill bring the arsenic, and don’t mind about his incantations.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will not\r\noffend me, you know,” said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly. “I\r\ndon’t translate my own convenience into other people’s duties. I am\r\nopposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don’t like the set he belongs to:\r\nthey are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors\r\nuncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of\r\nworldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as\r\na doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven. But,” he added,\r\nsmilingly, “I don’t say that Bulstrode’s new hospital is a bad thing;\r\nand as to his wanting to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me\r\na mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment. And I am not a\r\nmodel clergyman—only a decent makeshift.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A model\r\nclergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the\r\nfinest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his\r\nmoral pathology and therapeutics. He only said, “What reason does\r\nBulstrode give for superseding you?”\r\n\r\n“That I don’t teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual religion; and\r\nthat I have no time to spare. Both statements are true. But then I\r\ncould make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds. That is the\r\nplain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it. I only wanted to tell\r\nyou that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me in\r\nconsequence. I can’t spare you. You are a sort of circumnavigator come\r\nto settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes. Now\r\ntell me all about them in Paris.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth\r\nDraw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,\r\nBreathing bad air, run risk of pestilence;\r\nOr, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,\r\nMay languish with the scurvy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the\r\nchaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without\r\ntelling himself the reason, he deferred the predetermination on which\r\nside he should give his vote. It would really have been a matter of\r\ntotal indifference to him—that is to say, he would have taken the more\r\nconvenient side, and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without\r\nany hesitation—if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\nBut his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph’s grew with growing\r\nacquaintanceship. That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a new-comer\r\nwho had his own professional objects to secure, Mr. Farebrother should\r\nhave taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest, showed\r\nan unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly\r\nalive to. It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother\r\nwhich were exceptionally fine, and made his character resemble those\r\nsouthern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and\r\nsocial slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and\r\nchivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence\r\non him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself;\r\nfew men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not\r\nto dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of\r\nbetter motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life would\r\nbear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a\r\nlittle defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose\r\ncelestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners, and\r\nwhose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions. Then,\r\nhis preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the\r\nEnglish Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered\r\nwithout book. People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to\r\nfill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s\r\nfunction, here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority.\r\nBesides, he was a likable man: sweet-tempered, ready-witted, frank,\r\nwithout grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors\r\nwhich make half of us an affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him\r\nheartily, and wished for his friendship.\r\n\r\nWith this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the\r\nchaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper\r\nbusiness of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for\r\nhis vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans\r\nfor the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were\r\noften in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could\r\ncount in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special\r\nrecurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When\r\nthe General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had\r\nnotice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of\r\nthe directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had\r\na vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch\r\nbusiness. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration\r\nthat Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a\r\nquestion of office or no office; and he could not help an equally\r\npronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his\r\nobservation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that\r\nthe banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty\r\npolitics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative\r\nprocess of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold\r\na court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things\r\nto be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on\r\nhis hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on\r\nnon-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated\r\nshock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously\r\nplay for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently\r\nliking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory\r\nfor the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was\r\nstagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have\r\nplayed very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at\r\nthe Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the\r\nchief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate\r\nbilliard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there\r\nwere reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had\r\nwon money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared\r\nfor it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no\r\nPuritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had\r\nalways seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which\r\nmade this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums\r\nthoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been\r\nsupplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was\r\nalways to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a\r\ngentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting\r\nhalf-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,\r\nbut he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part\r\nwhich the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money\r\nhad never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses\r\nfor this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive\r\nto him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between\r\nthe Vicar’s income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was\r\npossible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told\r\nmore strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before. One\r\nwould know much better what to do if men’s characters were more\r\nconsistent, and especially if one’s friends were invariably fit for any\r\nfunction they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if there\r\nhad been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have voted for\r\nhim, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he did not\r\nintend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was\r\nTyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply\r\ncurate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for\r\nextra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that\r\nthey could not bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his\r\npoint of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified.\r\n\r\nBut whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make\r\nhim wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being\r\nobliged to wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by\r\ngetting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against\r\nFarebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the\r\nquestion occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave\r\nthe Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover,\r\nLydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he\r\nshould be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself. But\r\nwould the end really be his own convenience? Other people would say so,\r\nand would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake\r\nof making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He\r\nfor his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been\r\nconcerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s\r\nfriendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his\r\nwork, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to\r\nprefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could\r\ndemonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic\r\nresults, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the\r\nfirst time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of\r\nsmall social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end\r\nof his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was\r\nreally in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to\r\nthe question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for\r\nvoting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is\r\nbegotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making\r\nresolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more\r\ndifficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on\r\nwhich side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting\r\nthe subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed\r\nbeforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his\r\nunmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find\r\nhimself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of\r\nwhich was repugnant to him. In his student’s chambers, he had\r\nprearranged his social action quite differently.\r\n\r\nLydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other\r\nsurgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.\r\nBulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still\r\nabsent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was\r\nproblematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had\r\nbeen generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out\r\nto be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred\r\nin action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had\r\nforeseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than\r\nsuspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this\r\ndeficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is\r\nprobable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the\r\nworld-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still\r\npotent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas\r\nof frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor\r\nwhich made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;\r\nconditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of\r\njudgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if\r\nany medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having\r\nvery definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of\r\notherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general\r\npresumption against his medical skill.\r\n\r\nOn this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for Dr.\r\nMinchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such\r\nas gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of\r\nChurch or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets. If\r\nMr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine\r\nof justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.\r\nMinchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a\r\nfortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a\r\nparticular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin\r\nfor his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to\r\nfixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian\r\nCreed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the\r\nrather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring\r\nwell-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was\r\ngenerally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes\r\nspent his holidays at “the palace.”\r\n\r\nDr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline,\r\nnot to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas\r\nDr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the\r\nknees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed\r\nnecessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him go in and out, and\r\nup and down, as if he had come to see after the roofing. In short, he\r\nhad weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw\r\nit; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to\r\ncircumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of\r\nmedical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt\r\nfor each other’s skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch\r\ninstitutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and\r\nagainst non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they\r\nwere both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.\r\nMinchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed\r\nfrom him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found\r\nthat Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A layman who pried\r\ninto the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding\r\nhis reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two\r\nphysicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by\r\ncontract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as\r\nsuch; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,\r\nexcited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The\r\nlong-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just\r\nnow standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed\r\nthat Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.\r\nTo non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other\r\nyoung practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s\r\nretirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such\r\nargument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from\r\nhis having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge. It\r\nwas clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast\r\nimputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his\r\nown rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in\r\nthe interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various\r\ngrades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the\r\nEnglish universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside\r\nstudy there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in\r\nEdinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but\r\nhardly sound.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with\r\nLydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of\r\ninterchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were\r\nenabled to form the same judgment concerning it.\r\n\r\nDr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he\r\nentered, “I go for Farebrother. A salary, with all my heart. But why\r\ntake it from the Vicar? He has none too much—has to insure his life,\r\nbesides keeping house, and doing a vicar’s charities. Put forty pounds\r\nin his pocket and you’ll do no harm. He’s a good fellow, is\r\nFarebrother, with as little of the parson about him as will serve to\r\ncarry orders.”\r\n\r\n“Ho, ho! Doctor,” said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger of some\r\nstanding—his interjection being something between a laugh and a\r\nParliamentary disapproval; “we must let you have your say. But what we\r\nhave to consider is not anybody’s income—it’s the souls of the poor\r\nsick people”—here Mr. Powderell’s voice and face had a sincere pathos\r\nin them. “He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke. I should vote\r\nagainst my conscience if I voted against Mr. Tyke—I should indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Tyke’s opponents have not asked any one to vote against his\r\nconscience, I believe,” said Mr. Hackbutt, a rich tanner of fluent\r\nspeech, whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with\r\nsome severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell. “But in my judgment it\r\nbehoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it as our\r\nwhole business to carry out propositions emanating from a single\r\nquarter. Will any member of the committee aver that he would have\r\nentertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always\r\ndischarged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested\r\nto him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution\r\nof this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views? I tax no\r\nman’s motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I\r\ndo say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible\r\nwith genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually\r\ndictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves\r\ncould not afford either morally or financially to avow. I myself am a\r\nlayman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions\r\nin the Church and—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn the divisions!” burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and\r\ntown-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked\r\nin hurriedly, whip in hand. “We have nothing to do with them here.\r\nFarebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without pay, and if\r\npay is to be given, it should be given to him. I call it a confounded\r\njob to take the thing away from Farebrother.”\r\n\r\n“I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a\r\npersonal bearing,” said Mr. Plymdale. “I shall vote for the appointment\r\nof Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr. Hackbutt hadn’t hinted\r\nit, that I was a Servile Crawler.”\r\n\r\n“I disclaim any personalities. I expressly said, if I may be allowed to\r\nrepeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, here’s Minchin!” said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned\r\naway from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior\r\ngifts in Middlemarch. “Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right side,\r\neh?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here and\r\nthere; “at whatever cost to my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“If there’s any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is\r\nturned out, I think,” said Mr. Frank Hawley.\r\n\r\n“I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a divided\r\nesteem,” said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands. “I consider Mr. Tyke an\r\nexemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be proposed from\r\nunimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I could give him my\r\nvote. But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the\r\npreponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims. He is an amiable man, an\r\nable preacher, and has been longer among us.”\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent. Mr. Plymdale settled his\r\ncravat, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“You don’t set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman ought to\r\nbe, I hope,” said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who had just come\r\nin. “I have no ill-will towards him, but I think we owe something to\r\nthe public, not to speak of anything higher, in these appointments. In\r\nmy opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman. I don’t wish to\r\nbring up particulars against him; but he will make a little attendance\r\nhere go as far as he can.”\r\n\r\n“And a devilish deal better than too much,” said Mr. Hawley, whose bad\r\nlanguage was notorious in that part of the county. “Sick people can’t\r\nbear so much praying and preaching. And that methodistical sort of\r\nreligion is bad for the spirits—bad for the inside, eh?” he added,\r\nturning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.\r\n\r\nBut any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,\r\nwith whom there were greetings more or less cordial. These were the\r\nReverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter’s, Mr. Bulstrode, and our\r\nfriend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put\r\non the board of directors in his turn, but had never before attended,\r\nhis attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions. Lydgate was\r\nthe only person still expected.\r\n\r\nEvery one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and\r\nself-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished\r\nfor the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,\r\nofficiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive\r\nto leave him ample time for the new duty. It was desirable that\r\nchaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent\r\nintention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;\r\nand while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the\r\nmore need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted\r\ninto a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger’s manner had so much quiet\r\npropriety that objectors could only simmer in silence.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter. He had not\r\nhimself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a\r\nstrong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was\r\nmost happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—“any\r\npublic question, you know,” Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of\r\nperfect understanding. “I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and\r\nin the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as\r\nbeing at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have\r\nconvinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very\r\ngood thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the\r\nappointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man,\r\napostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last\r\nman to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the\r\nquestion, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,\r\nand was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem\r\nto know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as\r\nchaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to\r\nsupersede him.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has been fully\r\ninformed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and position.”\r\n\r\n“By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.\r\n\r\n“I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said Mr.\r\nThesiger.\r\n\r\n“I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, “the merits of the\r\nquestion may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that\r\nevery gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully\r\ninformed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh\r\non either side.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we all know\r\nwhom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait\r\ntill the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time\r\nto lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once.”\r\n\r\nA brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote\r\n“Tyke” or “Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass\r\ntumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.\r\n\r\n“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr.\r\nBulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate—\r\n\r\n“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:\r\nwill you be good enough to write?”\r\n\r\n“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how\r\nMr. Lydgate will vote.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,\r\nrather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.\r\n\r\n“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you\r\nregard that meaning as offensive?”\r\n\r\n“It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting with\r\nhim on that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down “Tyke.”\r\n\r\nSo the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate\r\ncontinued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether\r\nTyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness\r\ntold him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should\r\nhave voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained a\r\nsore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of\r\nMiddlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man be satisfied\r\nwith a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?\r\nNo more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from\r\namong such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at\r\nbest with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The\r\ncharacter of the publican and sinner is not always practically\r\nincompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us\r\nscarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the\r\nfaultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But\r\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped the slightest tincture\r\nof the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too\r\nmuch as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in\r\nthis—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and\r\ncould judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.\r\n\r\n“The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,” he said one day to\r\nLydgate. “But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of\r\nrenown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it\r\neasy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another\r\nstory says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore the\r\nNessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if\r\neverybody else’s resolve helped him.”\r\n\r\nThe Vicar’s talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped being a\r\nPharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities\r\nwhich we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure.\r\nLydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr.\r\nFarebrother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n“L’ altra vedete ch’ha fatto alla guancia\r\nDella sua palma, sospirando, letto.”\r\n—_Purgatorio_, vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of\r\nWindsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr. Vincy\r\nwas mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs. Casaubon, born\r\nDorothea Brooke, had taken her wedding journey to Rome. In those days\r\nthe world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years\r\nthan it is at present. Travellers did not often carry full information\r\non Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the\r\nmost brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed\r\ntomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter’s\r\nfancy. Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love\r\nand knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and\r\nentered into everybody’s food; it was fermenting still as a\r\ndistinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German\r\nartists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled\r\nnear them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but\r\nabundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his equipment, had\r\njust turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was\r\nlooking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining\r\nround vestibule. He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the\r\napproach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him and placing\r\na hand on his shoulder, said with a strong accent, “Come here, quick!\r\nelse she will have changed her pose.”\r\n\r\nQuickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed lightly\r\nalong by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne,\r\nthen called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble voluptuousness of her\r\nbeauty, the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and\r\ntenderness. They were just in time to see another figure standing\r\nagainst a pedestal near the reclining marble: a breathing blooming\r\ngirl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray\r\ndrapery; her long cloak, fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from\r\nher arms, and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek, pushing\r\nsomewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to\r\nher face around the simply braided dark-brown hair. She was not looking\r\nat the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes were\r\nfixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor. But\r\nshe became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused as if to\r\ncontemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at them, immediately\r\nturned away to join a maid-servant and courier who were loitering along\r\nthe hall at a little distance off.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?” said the\r\nGerman, searching in his friend’s face for responding admiration, but\r\ngoing on volubly without waiting for any other answer. “There lies\r\nantique beauty, not corpse-like even in death, but arrested in the\r\ncomplete contentment of its sensuous perfection: and here stands beauty\r\nin its breathing life, with the consciousness of Christian centuries in\r\nits bosom. But she should be dressed as a nun; I think she looks almost\r\nwhat you call a Quaker; I would dress her as a nun in my picture.\r\nHowever, she is married; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left\r\nhand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow _Geistlicher_ was her\r\nfather. I saw him parting from her a good while ago, and just now I\r\nfound her in that magnificent pose. Only think! he is perhaps rich, and\r\nwould like to have her portrait taken. Ah! it is no use looking after\r\nher—there she goes! Let us follow her home!”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said his companion, with a little frown.\r\n\r\n“You are singular, Ladislaw. You look struck together. Do you know\r\nher?”\r\n\r\n“I know that she is married to my cousin,” said Will Ladislaw,\r\nsauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German\r\nfriend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.\r\n\r\n“What! the _Geistlicher_? He looks more like an uncle—a more useful\r\nsort of relation.”\r\n\r\n“He is not my uncle. I tell you he is my second cousin,” said Ladislaw,\r\nwith some irritation.\r\n\r\n“Schön, schön. Don’t be snappish. You are not angry with me for\r\nthinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw?”\r\n\r\n“Angry? nonsense. I have only seen her once before, for a couple of\r\nminutes, when my cousin introduced her to me, just before I left\r\nEngland. They were not married then. I didn’t know they were coming to\r\nRome.”\r\n\r\n“But you will go to see them now—you will find out what they have for\r\nan address—since you know the name. Shall we go to the post? And you\r\ncould speak about the portrait.”\r\n\r\n“Confound you, Naumann! I don’t know what I shall do. I am not so\r\nbrazen as you.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish. If you were\r\nan artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form\r\nanimated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian Antigone—sensuous\r\nforce controlled by spiritual passion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her\r\nexistence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but\r\nexhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am amateurish if\r\nyou like: I do _not_ think that all the universe is straining towards\r\nthe obscure significance of your pictures.”\r\n\r\n“But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf\r\nNaumann: that stands firm,” said the good-natured painter, putting a\r\nhand on Ladislaw’s shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the\r\nunaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone. “See now! My existence\r\npresupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it _not?_ and my\r\nfunction is to paint—and as a painter I have a conception which is\r\naltogether _genialisch_, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a\r\nsubject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards\r\nthat picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth\r\nin the shape of me—not true?”\r\n\r\n“But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart\r\nit?—the case is a little less simple then.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing—picture or no\r\npicture—logically.”\r\n\r\nWill could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his\r\nface broke into sunshiny laughter.\r\n\r\n“Come now, my friend—you will help?” said Naumann, in a hopeful tone.\r\n\r\n“No; nonsense, Naumann! English ladies are not at everybody’s service\r\nas models. And you want to express too much with your painting. You\r\nwould only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which\r\nevery connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And\r\nwhat is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff\r\nafter all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them.\r\nLanguage is a finer medium.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for those who can’t paint,” said Naumann. “There you have perfect\r\nright. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.”\r\n\r\nThe amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to\r\nappear stung. He went on as if he had not heard.\r\n\r\n“Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being\r\nvague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at you\r\nwith an insistent imperfection. I feel that especially about\r\nrepresentations of women. As if a woman were a mere colored\r\nsuperficies! You must wait for movement and tone. There is a difference\r\nin their very breathing: they change from moment to moment.—This woman\r\nwhom you have just seen, for example: how would you paint her voice,\r\npray? But her voice is much diviner than anything you have seen of\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think that he\r\ncan paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt! ‘Der\r\nNeffe als Onkel’ in a tragic sense—_ungeheuer!_”\r\n\r\n“You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“How is she to be called then?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n“Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and find that\r\nshe very much wishes to be painted?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, suppose!” said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,\r\nintended to dismiss the subject. He was conscious of being irritated by\r\nridiculously small causes, which were half of his own creation. Why was\r\nhe making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet he felt as if something\r\nhad happened to him with regard to her. There are characters which are\r\ncontinually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in dramas\r\nwhich nobody is prepared to act with them. Their susceptibilities will\r\nclash against objects that remain innocently quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n“A child forsaken, waking suddenly,\r\nWhose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,\r\nAnd seeth only that it cannot see\r\n    The meeting eyes of love.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a\r\nhandsome apartment in the Via Sistina.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment\r\nto this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled\r\nby pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will\r\nsometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone. And Mr. Casaubon\r\nwas certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican.\r\n\r\nYet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state\r\neven to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion,\r\nthe mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a\r\nself-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her\r\nown spiritual poverty. She had married the man of her choice, and with\r\nthe advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage\r\nchiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had\r\nthought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he\r\nmust often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share;\r\nmoreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was\r\nbeholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole\r\nhemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral\r\nimages and trophies gathered from afar.\r\n\r\nBut this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike\r\nstrangeness of her bridal life. Dorothea had now been five weeks in\r\nRome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go\r\nhand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently\r\nsurvive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at first with Mr.\r\nCasaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced\r\ncourier. She had been led through the best galleries, had been taken to\r\nthe chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the\r\nmost glorious churches, and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive\r\nout to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky,\r\naway-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too\r\nseemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes.\r\n\r\nTo those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a\r\nknowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and\r\ntraces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome\r\nmay still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world. But let\r\nthem conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken\r\nrevelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the\r\nnotions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss\r\nPuritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of\r\nthe hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small\r\nallowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their\r\nmould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the\r\nquality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,\r\nand from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself\r\nplunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot. The weight\r\nof unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it\r\nformed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;\r\nbut Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and\r\nbasilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,\r\nwhere all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep\r\ndegeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but\r\nyet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the\r\nlong vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the\r\nmonotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious\r\nideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of\r\nbreathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an\r\nelectric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache\r\nbelonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.\r\nForms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and\r\nfixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them,\r\npreparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.\r\nOur moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other\r\nlike the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of\r\ndull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of\r\nSt. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the\r\nattitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics\r\nabove, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading\r\nitself everywhere like a disease of the retina.\r\n\r\nNot that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very\r\nexceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among\r\nincongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their\r\nelders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.\r\nCasaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding,\r\nthe situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discouragement, some\r\nfaintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,\r\nis not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what\r\nis not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of\r\nfrequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of\r\nmankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had\r\na keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like\r\nhearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die\r\nof that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the\r\nquickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the\r\ncause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have\r\nalready used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been\r\nlike trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new\r\nreal future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from\r\nthe endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely\r\nrelation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with\r\nthe secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden\r\ndream. It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least\r\nadmit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that\r\ndevotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she\r\nwas almost sure sooner or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion, the\r\ndisorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not\r\npossible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of\r\nher nature heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of\r\nmarriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a\r\nshrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nBut was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his forms of\r\nexpression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable? Oh\r\nwaywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him, or his ability\r\nto state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his\r\nprovision for giving the heads of any subject on demand? And was not\r\nRome the place in all the world to give free play to such\r\naccomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea’s enthusiasm especially\r\ndwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness\r\nwith which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?— And that\r\nsuch weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.\r\n\r\nAll these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,\r\nthe light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday.\r\nThe fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are\r\nacquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few\r\nimaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of\r\nmarried companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than\r\nwhat you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether\r\nthe same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is\r\nfelt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings\r\nwith a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician\r\nin the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases\r\ntoo we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we sometimes end\r\nby inverting the quantities.\r\n\r\nStill, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of\r\nflashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as\r\nany ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any\r\nillusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her\r\nmarriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling\r\ndepression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had\r\ndreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and\r\nwinding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that\r\nin courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and\r\nthe smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee\r\ndelightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But\r\nthe door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on\r\nthe present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is\r\nimpossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not\r\nwithin sight—that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.\r\n\r\nIn their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on\r\nsome explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see\r\nthe bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness\r\nof their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she\r\nhad listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments\r\nto be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the\r\nPhilistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter\r\nshe should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same\r\nhigh ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him. Again,\r\nthe matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he\r\ntreated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily\r\naccounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in\r\nwhich she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they\r\nhad been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to\r\ntumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,\r\nshe had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that\r\nher mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and\r\nrepulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker\r\nor any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could\r\nnot have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of\r\ncommenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to\r\naffect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best\r\nintention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting\r\nhimself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such\r\ncapacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by\r\nthe general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried\r\npreparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen he said, “Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a little\r\nlonger? I am ready to stay if you wish it,”—it seemed to her as if\r\ngoing or staying were alike dreary. Or, “Should you like to go to the\r\nFarnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos designed or painted\r\nby Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.”\r\n\r\n“But do you care about them?” was always Dorothea’s question.\r\n\r\n“They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent the fable\r\nof Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a\r\nliterary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine mythical\r\nproduct. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily drive\r\nthither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of\r\nRaphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome. He is\r\nthe painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of\r\nform with sublimity of expression. Such at least I have gathered to be\r\nthe opinion of cognoscenti.”\r\n\r\nThis kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a\r\nclergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the\r\nglories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew\r\nmore about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her. There\r\nis hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than\r\nthat of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in\r\na blank absence of interest or sympathy.\r\n\r\nOn other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation\r\nand an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of\r\nenthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous\r\ndirection of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she\r\ndragged him away from it. But she was gradually ceasing to expect with\r\nher former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening\r\nwhere she followed him. Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small\r\nclosets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the\r\nCabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists’ ill-considered\r\nparallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to\r\nthese labors. With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of\r\nwindows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about\r\nthe solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,\r\nmight have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been\r\nencouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would\r\nhave held her hands between his and listened with the delight of\r\ntenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up\r\nher experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in\r\nreturn, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual\r\nknowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with\r\nthose childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who\r\nhas begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,\r\ncreating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own\r\nlove. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all her yearning to know what was\r\nafar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what\r\nwas near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have\r\ncaressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of\r\nacceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of\r\na most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same\r\ntime by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these\r\nmanifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical\r\ntoilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those\r\namenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat\r\nof the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.\r\n\r\nAnd by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed like\r\nmelting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been\r\nbut another form. She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of\r\nfeeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all\r\nher strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of\r\ndespondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,\r\ntransforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she was\r\ncertainly troublesome—to herself chiefly; but this morning for the\r\nfirst time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\nShe had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to\r\nshake off what she inwardly called her selfishness, and turned a face\r\nall cheerful attention to her husband when he said, “My dear Dorothea,\r\nwe must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to\r\nour departure. I would fain have returned home earlier that we might\r\nhave been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been\r\nprotracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the\r\ntime here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of\r\nEurope, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in\r\nsome respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch\r\nin my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of\r\nNapoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I\r\nthink it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has\r\nbeen applied—‘See Rome and die:’ but in your case I would propose an\r\nemendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy\r\nwife.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious\r\nintention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and\r\nconcluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state,\r\nbut he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable\r\nhusband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n“I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the\r\nresult so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea, trying to\r\nkeep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes\r\nthe word half a negative. “I have been led farther than I had foreseen,\r\nand various subjects for annotation have presented themselves which,\r\nthough I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit. The task,\r\nnotwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a somewhat\r\nlaborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from that too\r\ncontinuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study which has\r\nbeen the snare of my solitary life.”\r\n\r\n“I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,” said\r\nDorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed\r\nthat Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to\r\nget to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her\r\nreply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,\r\nand be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The notes\r\nI have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract\r\nthem under my direction.”\r\n\r\n“And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned\r\nwithin her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking\r\nwith her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what\r\nyou used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them\r\nyou will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast\r\nknowledge useful to the world? I will write to your dictation, or I\r\nwill copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.”\r\nDorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a\r\nslight sob and eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\nThe excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly\r\ndisturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea’s\r\nwords were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could\r\nhave been impelled to use. She was as blind to his inward troubles as\r\nhe to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her\r\nhusband which claim our pity. She had not yet listened patiently to his\r\nheartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently. In Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those\r\nmuffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain\r\nas mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when\r\nsuch suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without, they are\r\nresisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full\r\nacceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in\r\nhard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those\r\nconfused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if\r\nthey were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was\r\nthere in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of\r\nobserving his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the\r\nuncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present\r\nherself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.\r\nHere, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a\r\nsensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal quickness to imagine\r\nmore than the fact. He had formerly observed with approbation her\r\ncapacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden\r\nterror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this\r\nworship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees\r\nvaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it\r\ncosts to reach them.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s face\r\nhad a quick angry flush upon it.\r\n\r\n“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may\r\nrely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the\r\ndifferent stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile\r\nconjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a\r\ntemporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the\r\ntrial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn\r\nof chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed\r\nequipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be admonished\r\nto discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter lies\r\nentirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may be\r\ncompassed by a narrow and superficial survey.”\r\n\r\nThis speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual\r\nwith Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but had\r\ntaken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round grains\r\nfrom a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only his\r\nwife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds\r\nthe appreciated or desponding author.\r\n\r\nDorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing\r\neverything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship\r\nwith her husband’s chief interests?\r\n\r\n“My judgment _was_ a very superficial one—such as I am capable of\r\nforming,” she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no\r\nrehearsal. “You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken\r\nof them—you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never\r\nheard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were very\r\nsimple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you to let\r\nme be of some good to you.”\r\n\r\nDorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking\r\nup a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both were\r\nshocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger\r\ntowards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in\r\nordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less\r\nembarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is\r\nto isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each\r\nother, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and\r\nstultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed\r\nyourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to\r\nfind conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without\r\nlooking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the\r\ntoughest minds. To Dorothea’s inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed\r\nlike a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was\r\na new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found\r\nhimself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had\r\nbeen able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged\r\nhim to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously\r\ngiven), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just\r\nwhere he most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against\r\nthe cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given\r\nit a more substantial presence?\r\n\r\nNeither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have\r\nreversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been\r\na show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,\r\nseeing that she already began to feel herself guilty. However just her\r\nindignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give\r\ntenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.\r\nCasaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of\r\ninscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the\r\nLibrary, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what\r\nwas around her. She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would\r\ndrive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann\r\nhad first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at\r\nthe same time with her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with\r\nwhom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical\r\nmediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined the figure, and\r\nhad walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw\r\nlingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where\r\nhe again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which\r\nmade her pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight\r\non the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing the\r\nlight of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and\r\nelms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the way in which\r\nthey might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as\r\nit had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a current into which all\r\nthought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow—the reaching\r\nforward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth, the least\r\npartial good. There was clearly something better than anger and\r\ndespondency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n“Hire facounde eke full womanly and plain,\r\nNo contrefeted termes had she\r\nTo semen wise.”\r\n—CHAUCER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was\r\nsecurely alone. But she was presently roused by a knock at the door,\r\nwhich made her hastily dry her eyes before saying, “Come in.” Tantripp\r\nhad brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the\r\nlobby. The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,\r\nbut he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon’s: would she see him?\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dorothea, without pause; “show him into the salon.” Her\r\nchief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him\r\nat Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon’s generosity towards\r\nhim, and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about\r\nhis career. She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for\r\nactive sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come\r\nto shake her out of her self-absorbed discontent—to remind her of her\r\nhusband’s goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be\r\nhis helpmate in all kind deeds. She waited a minute or two, but when\r\nshe passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had\r\nbeen crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than\r\nusual. She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which is\r\nunmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. He was the elder by\r\nseveral years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for his\r\ntransparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a shyness\r\nextremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male\r\ncompanion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering desire\r\nto put him at ease.\r\n\r\n“I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this\r\nmorning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,” he said. “I knew you at\r\nonce—but—I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon’s address would be found\r\nat the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to him and\r\nyou as early as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Pray sit down. He is not here now, but he will be glad to hear of you,\r\nI am sure,” said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between the\r\nfire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair\r\nopposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. The signs of girlish\r\nsorrow in her face were only the more striking. “Mr. Casaubon is much\r\nengaged; but you will leave your address—will you not?—and he will\r\nwrite to you.”\r\n\r\n“You are very good,” said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his diffidence in\r\nthe interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had\r\naltered her face. “My address is on my card. But if you will allow me I\r\nwill call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to be\r\nat home.”\r\n\r\n“He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can\r\nhardly see him except by an appointment. Especially now. We are about\r\nto leave Rome, and he is very busy. He is usually away almost from\r\nbreakfast till dinner. But I am sure he will wish you to dine with us.”\r\n\r\nWill Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments. He had never been fond\r\nof Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of obligation,\r\nwould have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition. But the idea of this\r\ndried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations about as\r\nimportant as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor’s\r\nback chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to marry\r\nhim, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after his\r\nmouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture\r\nstirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the\r\nimpulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst\r\ninto scornful invective.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion\r\nof his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved it into\r\nnothing more offensive than a merry smile.\r\n\r\nDorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from\r\nher face too. Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were\r\nangry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating\r\nthe transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve\r\nand line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and\r\nbanishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that smile\r\ncould not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark\r\neyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, “Something amuses\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Will, quick in finding resources. “I am thinking of the\r\nsort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my\r\npoor sketch with your criticism.”\r\n\r\n“My criticism?” said Dorothea, wondering still more. “Surely not. I\r\nalways feel particularly ignorant about painting.”\r\n\r\n“I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what\r\nwas most cutting. You said—I dare say you don’t remember it as I\r\ndo—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.\r\nAt least, you implied that.” Will could laugh now as well as smile.\r\n\r\n“That was really my ignorance,” said Dorothea, admiring Will’s\r\ngood-humor. “I must have said so only because I never could see any\r\nbeauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought very\r\nfine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome. There\r\nare comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At first when\r\nI enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or with rare\r\npictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great ceremonies\r\nwhere there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself in the\r\npresence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to examine\r\nthe pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something\r\nviolent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so\r\nmuch all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes\r\none feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine\r\nand not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind,\r\nwhile people talk of the sky.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be\r\nacquired,” said Will. (It was impossible now to doubt the directness of\r\nDorothea’s confession.) “Art is an old language with a great many\r\nartificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets\r\nout of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of\r\nall sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to\r\npieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is\r\nsomething in daubing a little one’s self, and having an idea of the\r\nprocess.”\r\n\r\n“You mean perhaps to be a painter?” said Dorothea, with a new direction\r\nof interest. “You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon\r\nwill like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”\r\n\r\n“No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness. “I have quite made up my\r\nmind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a great\r\ndeal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with one of\r\nthem. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not like to\r\nget into their way of looking at the world entirely from the studio\r\npoint of view.”\r\n\r\n“That I can understand,” said Dorothea, cordially. “And in Rome it\r\nseems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the\r\nworld than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it\r\nnot be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better\r\nthings than these—or different, so that there might not be so many\r\npictures almost all alike in the same place.”\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into\r\nfrankness. “A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that\r\nsort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing\r\nwell what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it\r\nworth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of\r\ndrudgery. If things don’t come easily to me I never get them.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, gently. She was rather shocked at this mode of taking\r\nall life as a holiday.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon’s opinion. He and I differ.”\r\n\r\nThe slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.\r\nShe was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her\r\nmorning’s trouble.\r\n\r\n“Certainly you differ,” she said, rather proudly. “I did not think of\r\ncomparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s is not common.”\r\n\r\nWill saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional\r\nimpulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.\r\nCasaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping\r\nthis husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the\r\nhusband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out\r\nof their neighbor’s buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” he answered, promptly. “And therefore it is a pity that\r\nit should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want\r\nof knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr. Casaubon\r\nread German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.\r\n\r\n“I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have\r\ntaken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which\r\nare got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have\r\nmade good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened\r\nhimself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read\r\na Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.”\r\n\r\nWill only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that\r\nvaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which\r\nDorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep\r\nhimself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in\r\norder to pity another man’s shortcomings.\r\n\r\nPoor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her\r\nhusband’s life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the\r\nquestion whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him\r\nought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,\r\nbut sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nWill, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather\r\nashamed, imagining from Dorothea’s silence that he had offended her\r\nstill more; and having also a conscience about plucking the\r\ntail-feathers from a benefactor.\r\n\r\n“I regretted it especially,” he resumed, taking the usual course from\r\ndetraction to insincere eulogy, “because of my gratitude and respect\r\ntowards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents\r\nand character were less distinguished.”\r\n\r\nDorothea raised her eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and\r\nsaid in her saddest recitative, “How I wish I had learned German when I\r\nwas at Lausanne! There were plenty of German teachers. But now I can be\r\nof no use.”\r\n\r\nThere was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in\r\nDorothea’s last words. The question how she had come to accept Mr.\r\nCasaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that\r\nshe must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be\r\nanswered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she might be,\r\nshe was not disagreeable. She was not coldly clever and indirectly\r\nsatirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She was an angel\r\nbeguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the\r\nmelodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly\r\nand ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his mind.\r\n\r\nShe must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.\r\nAnd if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his\r\nlair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been\r\nan unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But\r\nhe was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor\r\nwith collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering\r\nthe room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while\r\nDorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and\r\nWill was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but\r\nhe did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose\r\nand explained his presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual, and\r\nthis perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the\r\neffect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young\r\ncousin’s appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of\r\nsunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing\r\nexpression. Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw\r\nlooked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in\r\nhis nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head\r\nquickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought\r\nthey saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the\r\ncontrary, stood rayless.\r\n\r\nAs Dorothea’s eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps\r\nnot insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other\r\ncauses in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf\r\nwhich was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the\r\nrealities of his lot and not by her own dreams. Yet it was a source of\r\ngreater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was\r\nagreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an\r\nimmense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any\r\none who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as\r\nwell as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in\r\nSouth Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could\r\nconverse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. Ladislaw\r\nunderstood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.\r\n\r\nDorothea’s eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down\r\nwearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head\r\nand looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she\r\nseated herself beside him, and said—\r\n\r\n“Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong. I\r\nfear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad that you feel that, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon. He spoke\r\nquietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy\r\nfeeling in his eyes as he looked at her.\r\n\r\n“But you do forgive me?” said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her need\r\nfor some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own\r\nfault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its\r\nneck and kiss it?\r\n\r\n“My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of\r\nheaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that\r\nsevere sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong\r\nstatement, and also to smile faintly.\r\n\r\nDorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would\r\ninsist on falling.\r\n\r\n“You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant\r\nconsequences of too much mental disturbance,” said Mr. Casaubon. In\r\nfact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have\r\nreceived young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from\r\nthe sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the\r\nmoment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to\r\navoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was\r\ntoo proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so\r\nexhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in\r\nother directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little\r\nfire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp\r\ndespondency of uneasy egoism.\r\n\r\n“I think it is time for us to dress,” he added, looking at his watch.\r\nThey both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them\r\nto what had passed on this day.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we\r\nall remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,\r\nor some new motive is born. Today she had begun to see that she had\r\nbeen under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from\r\nMr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there\r\nmight be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on\r\nhis side as on her own.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder\r\nto feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from\r\nthat stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she\r\nwould devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his\r\nstrength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is\r\nno longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness\r\nof sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre\r\nof self, whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n“Nous câusames longtemps; elle était simple et bonne.\r\nNe sachant pas le mal, elle faisait le bien;\r\nDes richesses du coeur elle me fit l’aumône,\r\nEt tout en écoutant comme le coeur se donne,\r\nSans oser y penser je lui donnai le mien;\r\nElle emporta ma vie, et n’en sut jamais rien.”\r\n—ALFRED DE MUSSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day, and\r\ngave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On the\r\ncontrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing\r\nher husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him\r\nthan she had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the listeners\r\nabout Tipton were not highly gifted! Will talked a good deal himself,\r\nbut what he said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with such an\r\nunimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed a gay\r\nlittle chime after the great bell. If Will was not always perfect, this\r\nwas certainly one of his good days. He described touches of incident\r\namong the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move\r\nabout freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the\r\nunsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and\r\nCatholicism; and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful\r\npicture of the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of\r\nRome, which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved\r\nyou from seeing the world’s ages as a set of box-like partitions\r\nwithout vital connection. Mr. Casaubon’s studies, Will observed, had\r\nalways been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps never felt\r\nany such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed that Rome had\r\ngiven him quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments\r\nstimulated his imagination and made him constructive. Then\r\noccasionally, but not too often, he appealed to Dorothea, and discussed\r\nwhat she said, as if her sentiment were an item to be considered in the\r\nfinal judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon. A sense\r\nof contributing to form the world’s opinion makes conversation\r\nparticularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not without his pride\r\nin his young wife, who spoke better than most women, as indeed he had\r\nperceived in choosing her.\r\n\r\nSince things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s statement that\r\nhis labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and\r\nthat after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying\r\nin Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away\r\nwithout seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That\r\nsort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a\r\nform of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its\r\npopulation of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct\r\nthem—not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could not but\r\nask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was now at her\r\nservice during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come\r\non the morrow and drive with them.\r\n\r\nWill could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.\r\nCasaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way\r\nto the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of\r\nthe chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only\r\nrevived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as\r\nmysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation\r\nto which the great souls of all periods became as it were\r\ncontemporaries. Will added that he had made himself Naumann’s pupil for\r\nthe nonce.\r\n\r\n“I have been making some oil-sketches under him,” said Will. “I hate\r\ncopying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting\r\nthe Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a\r\nsketch of Marlowe’s Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his\r\nChariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit\r\nhim with his excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo him in\r\nbreadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his chariot for the\r\ntremendous course of the world’s physical history lashing on the\r\nharnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical\r\ninterpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this\r\noffhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said Dorothea.\r\n“I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you\r\nintend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and clearings\r\nof forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can\r\nimagine!”\r\n\r\n“What a difficult kind of shorthand!” said Dorothea, smiling towards\r\nher husband. “It would require all your knowledge to be able to read\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He had a suspicion that he was\r\nbeing laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThey found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;\r\nhis pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious\r\nperson set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so\r\nthat everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful\r\nyoung English lady exactly at that time.\r\n\r\nThe painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his\r\nfinished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as\r\nmuch as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words\r\nof praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and\r\nDorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the\r\nsignificance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones\r\nwith the simple country as a background, and of saints with\r\narchitectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in\r\ntheir skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were\r\ngathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was\r\napparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not\r\ninterested himself.\r\n\r\n“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to\r\nread it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures\r\nsooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking\r\nto Will.\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will tell\r\nyou, it is all _pfuscherei_, which is his most opprobrious word!”\r\n\r\n“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who\r\nmade a slight grimace and said—\r\n\r\n“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must be\r\n_belles-lettres_. That is wi-ide.”\r\n\r\nNaumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word\r\nsatirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.\r\nCasaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent,\r\nbegan to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.\r\n\r\nThe respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside\r\nfor a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.\r\nCasaubon, came forward again and said—\r\n\r\n“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a\r\nsketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas\r\nAquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see\r\njust what I want—the idealistic in the real.”\r\n\r\n“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved\r\nwith a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been\r\naccustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to\r\nyou in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel\r\nhonored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;\r\nand if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”\r\n\r\nAs for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had\r\nbeen a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and\r\nworthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith would\r\nhave become firm again.\r\n\r\nNaumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the\r\nsketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down\r\nand subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a\r\nlong while before. Every one about her seemed good, and she said to\r\nherself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been\r\nfull of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature\r\ncould be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed\r\nin the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,\r\nand was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nThe adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English\r\npolities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched\r\nhimself on some steps in the background overlooking all.\r\n\r\nPresently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and\r\ntake it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”\r\n\r\nWill vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is\r\ntoo strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—\r\n\r\n“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I\r\ncould not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day except\r\ngo about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.\r\n“It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with\r\npolite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head to\r\nidleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”\r\n\r\n“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went\r\non in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he\r\nwere considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round\r\nvaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards\r\nturning to Mr. Casaubon, said—\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling\r\nto let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of\r\nher—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single\r\nstudy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,\r\nand Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”\r\n\r\nNaumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to\r\nadjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected\r\nairs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when\r\nthe painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to\r\nstand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that\r\nstool, please, so!”\r\n\r\nWill was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet\r\nand kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he\r\nwas adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he\r\nrepented that he had brought her.\r\n\r\nThe artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and\r\noccupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the\r\nend prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear\r\nfrom his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann\r\ntook the hint and said—\r\n\r\n“Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it\r\nturned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect\r\nif another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the\r\nmorrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. The result of all\r\nwas so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the\r\npurchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the\r\ndoctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,\r\nbut listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The\r\nSanta Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared\r\nhimself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to\r\nmake a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement\r\nwas conditional.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that\r\nevening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will\r\njoined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail\r\nof Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption:\r\nthere was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words, and what\r\nbusiness had he to talk of her lips? She was not a woman to be spoken\r\nof as other women were. Will could not say just what he thought, but he\r\nbecame irritable. And yet, when after some resistance he had consented\r\nto take the Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he had been allured by\r\nthe gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant\r\nNaumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness—or rather her\r\ndivineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily\r\nprettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton and its\r\nneighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at\r\nher beauty being made so much of. In that part of the world Miss Brooke\r\nhad been only a “fine young woman.”)\r\n\r\n“Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon is not\r\nto be talked of as if she were a model,” said Will. Naumann stared at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Schön! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after\r\nall. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered\r\nto have his portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for\r\nvanity! It was as I thought: he cared much less for her portrait than\r\nhis own.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,” said Will, with\r\ngnashing impetuosity. His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to\r\nhis hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that he\r\ncould discharge them all by a check.\r\n\r\nNaumann gave a shrug and said, “It is good they go away soon, my dear.\r\nThey are spoiling your fine temper.”\r\n\r\nAll Will’s hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing\r\nDorothea when she was alone. He only wanted her to take more emphatic\r\nnotice of him; he only wanted to be something more special in her\r\nremembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be. He was\r\nrather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her\r\nusual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of\r\ntheir reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but in most cases the\r\nworshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by\r\nwhich his soul’s sovereign may cheer him without descending from her\r\nhigh place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty\r\nof contradictions in his imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see\r\nhow Dorothea’s eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr.\r\nCasaubon: she would have lost some of her halo if she had been without\r\nthat duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s\r\nsandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s longing\r\nto say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less tormenting\r\nbecause he felt the strongest reasons for restraining it.\r\n\r\nWill had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he persuaded\r\nhimself that he was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was\r\nthe middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home.\r\n\r\nDorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will\r\nhad displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing him,\r\nespecially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he entered\r\nshe was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia. She\r\ngreeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course, and said at\r\nonce, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—\r\n\r\n“I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos,\r\nand can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us\r\nin choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not\r\ntime. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three\r\ndays. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about\r\nthese little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is\r\nfine: it will just suit you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You\r\nsaw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at least\r\nI think so. We were never so long away from each other in our lives\r\nbefore. She is a great pet and never was naughty in her life. I found\r\nout before I came away that she wanted me to buy her some cameos, and I\r\nshould be sorry for them not to be good—after their kind.” Dorothea\r\nadded the last words with a smile.\r\n\r\n“You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself at some\r\ndistance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.\r\n\r\n“No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\n“I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should\r\nhave expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply. “I\r\nshould like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And then\r\nall this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life\r\nand make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment\r\nof anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously. “You\r\nmight say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you\r\ncarried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn\r\nevil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is to\r\nenjoy—when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth’s\r\ncharacter as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It is of no\r\nuse to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken care of\r\nwhen you feel delight—in art or in anything else. Would you turn all\r\nthe youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing\r\nover misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues\r\nof misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone\r\nfurther than he intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought\r\nwas not taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered\r\nwithout any special emotion—\r\n\r\n“Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never\r\nunhappy long together. I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I have a\r\ngreat outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help\r\nbelieving in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be quite\r\nwilling to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don’t know\r\nthe reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness\r\nrather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but\r\nthe feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.\r\nHere and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I\r\nmight compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian\r\nHill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the\r\nbest kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”\r\n\r\n“Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things\r\nwant that soil to grow in.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current\r\nof her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I\r\nhave often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would\r\nlook much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they could be\r\nput on the wall.”\r\n\r\nDorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but\r\nchanged her mind and paused.\r\n\r\n“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,”\r\nsaid Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to\r\nhim. “You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous—as\r\nif you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the\r\nlegend. You have been brought up in some of those horrible notions that\r\nchoose the sweetest women to devour—like Minotaurs. And now you will go\r\nand be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried\r\nalive. It makes me savage to think of it! I would rather never have\r\nseen you than think of you with such a prospect.”\r\n\r\nWill again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach\r\nto words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so\r\nmuch kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving\r\nout ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings\r\naround her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a\r\ngentle smile—\r\n\r\n“It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did\r\nnot like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of\r\nlife. But Lowick is my chosen home.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will\r\ndid not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to\r\nembrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was\r\nclear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent\r\nfor a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at\r\nlast what had been in her mind beforehand.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.\r\nPerhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that\r\nyou like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak\r\nhastily.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity\r\nquite new in her. “I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it\r\ngoes. I dare say I shall have to retract.”\r\n\r\n“I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I mean, for\r\nthe subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking\r\nabout it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must\r\nhave before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?”\r\nDorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was\r\nin the strange situation of consulting a third person about the\r\nadequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he would be\r\nduly reserved. “He is not an Orientalist, you know. He does not profess\r\nto have more than second-hand knowledge there.”\r\n\r\n“But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written\r\na long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern\r\nthings; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s not be\r\nvaluable, like theirs?” said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.\r\nShe was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had been having\r\nin her own mind.\r\n\r\n“That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also getting a\r\ntone of rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing\r\nas chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.\r\nWho wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to\r\nrefute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling\r\na little way after men of the last century—men like Bryant—and\r\ncorrecting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room and furbishing up\r\nbroken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?”\r\n\r\n“How can you bear to speak so lightly?” said Dorothea, with a look\r\nbetween sorrow and anger. “If it were as you say, what could be sadder\r\nthan so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you\r\nmore painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so\r\nmuch goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has\r\nbeen the labor of his best years.” She was beginning to be shocked that\r\nshe had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for\r\nhaving led her to it.\r\n\r\n“You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,” said\r\nWill. “But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not in\r\na position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at\r\nbest a pensioner’s eulogy.”\r\n\r\n“Pray excuse me,” said Dorothea, coloring deeply. “I am aware, as you\r\nsay, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am\r\nwrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than\r\nnever to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” said Will, determined to change the\r\nsituation—“so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that risk\r\nof never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has perhaps\r\nbeen dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has given\r\nme. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own way—depend on\r\nnobody else than myself.”\r\n\r\n“That is fine—I respect that feeling,” said Dorothea, with returning\r\nkindness. “But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything\r\nin the matter except what was most for your welfare.”\r\n\r\n“She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she\r\nhas married him,” said Will to himself. Aloud he said, rising—\r\n\r\n“I shall not see you again.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “I am so\r\nglad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.”\r\n\r\n“And I have made you angry,” said Will. “I have made you think ill of\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not say\r\njust what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them. In\r\nthe end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so\r\nimpatient.”\r\n\r\n“Still, you don’t like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. “I like you\r\nvery much.”\r\n\r\nWill was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have\r\nbeen of more importance if he had been disliked. He said nothing, but\r\nlooked dull, not to say sulky.\r\n\r\n“And I am quite interested to see what you will do,” Dorothea went on\r\ncheerfully. “I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation. If\r\nit were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow—there\r\nare so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant of. You\r\nwould hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and\r\nliterature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation will\r\nturn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?”\r\n\r\n“That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that\r\nno shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment\r\nis but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of\r\nemotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,\r\nand feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that\r\ncondition by fits only.”\r\n\r\n“But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea. “I think they are wanted\r\nto complete the poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge\r\npassing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But\r\nI am sure I could never produce a poem.”\r\n\r\n“You _are_ a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what makes\r\nup the poet’s consciousness in his best moods,” said Will, showing such\r\noriginality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and\r\nother endless renewals.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a\r\nbird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her\r\neyes. “What very kind things you say to me!”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind—that\r\nI could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never\r\nhave the opportunity.” Will spoke with fervor.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Dorothea, cordially. “It will come; and I shall remember\r\nhow well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I\r\nfirst saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.” There was\r\na certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that\r\nhis own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to\r\nMr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could\r\nhave spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her noble\r\nunsuspicious inexperience.\r\n\r\n“And there is one thing even now that you can do,” said Dorothea,\r\nrising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring\r\nimpulse. “Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that\r\nsubject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon’s writings—I mean in that kind of\r\nway. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise me.”\r\n\r\nShe had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking\r\ngravely at him.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I will promise you,” said Will, reddening however. If he\r\nnever said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off\r\nreceiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him\r\nthe more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at\r\nleast ready with that accomplishment. He said that he must go now\r\nwithout waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of\r\nat the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a\r\nsimple “Good-by.”\r\n\r\nBut going out of the _porte cochere_ he met Mr. Casaubon, and that\r\ngentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived\r\nthe pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be\r\nsufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.\r\n\r\n“I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I\r\nthink will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to her husband\r\nin the course of the evening. She had mentioned immediately on his\r\nentering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.\r\nCasaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I\r\nbelieve,” saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any\r\nsubject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish\r\nfor a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.\r\n\r\n“What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my love”\r\nwhen his manner was the coldest).\r\n\r\n“He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up\r\nhis dependence on your generosity. He means soon to go back to England,\r\nand work his own way. I thought you would consider that a good sign,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband’s neutral face.\r\n\r\n“Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would\r\naddict himself?”\r\n\r\n“No. But he said that he felt the danger which lay for him in your\r\ngenerosity. Of course he will write to you about it. Do you not think\r\nbetter of him for his resolve?”\r\n\r\n“I shall await his communication on the subject,” said Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\n“I told him I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for\r\nhim was his own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what you said\r\nabout him when I first saw him at Lowick,” said Dorothea, putting her\r\nhand on her husband’s.\r\n\r\n“I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on\r\nDorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance\r\nwhich he could not hinder from being uneasy. “The young man, I confess,\r\nis not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I think,\r\ndiscuss his future course, which it is not ours to determine beyond the\r\nlimits which I have sufficiently indicated.” Dorothea did not mention\r\nWill again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\nWAITING FOR DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n“Your horses of the Sun,” he said,\r\n    “And first-rate whip Apollo!\r\nWhate’er they be, I’ll eat my head,\r\n    But I will beat them hollow.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his mind, and though no such\r\nimmaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman\r\nfor many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this\r\ndebt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor\r\nwas Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company\r\nwas much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted\r\nto pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more\r\namusements than he had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been\r\naccommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and\r\nthe accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a\r\nsmall advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at\r\nbilliards. The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds. Bambridge was\r\nin no alarm about his money, being sure that young Vincy had backers;\r\nbut he had required something to show for it, and Fred had at first\r\ngiven a bill with his own signature. Three months later he had renewed\r\nthis bill with the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions Fred had\r\nfelt confident that he should meet the bill himself, having ample funds\r\nat disposal in his own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that his\r\nconfidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we\r\nknow, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable\r\ndisposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the\r\nfolly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater\r\nmystery of our high individual value in the universe, will bring about\r\nagreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good taste in\r\ncostume, and our general preference for the best style of thing. Fred\r\nfelt sure that he should have a present from his uncle, that he should\r\nhave a run of luck, that by dint of “swapping” he should gradually\r\nmetamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a\r\nhundred at any moment—“judgment” being always equivalent to an\r\nunspecified sum in hard cash. And in any case, even supposing negations\r\nwhich only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that\r\ntime) his father’s pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of\r\nhopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them. Of what\r\nmight be the capacity of his father’s pocket, Fred had only a vague\r\nnotion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of one\r\nyear be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in an\r\neasy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the\r\nfamily habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of\r\neconomy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion\r\nthat their father might pay for anything if he would. Mr. Vincy himself\r\nhad expensive Middlemarch habits—spent money on coursing, on his\r\ncellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts\r\nwith tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything\r\none wants without any question of payment. But it was in the nature of\r\nfathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a\r\nlittle storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and\r\nFred disliked bad weather within doors. He was too filial to be\r\ndisrespectful to his father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty\r\nthat it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see\r\nhis mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having\r\nfun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under\r\nscolding, it was chiefly for propriety’s sake. The easier course\r\nplainly, was to renew the bill with a friend’s signature. Why not? With\r\nthe superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was no reason\r\nwhy he should not have increased other people’s liabilities to any\r\nextent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything\r\nwere usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order\r\nof things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nWith a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to their\r\nmore amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and concerning\r\neach in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that he will be eager to\r\noblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as\r\nother warmth. Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed\r\nas but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened\r\nthat Fred checked off all his friends but one, on the ground that\r\napplying to them would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that\r\nhe at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had\r\na right to be free from anything disagreeable. That he should ever fall\r\ninto a thoroughly unpleasant position—wear trousers shrunk with\r\nwashing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to “duck\r\nunder” in any sort of way—was an absurdity irreconcilable with those\r\ncheerful intuitions implanted in him by nature. And Fred winced under\r\nthe idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.\r\nThus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at\r\nonce the poorest and the kindest—namely, Caleb Garth.\r\n\r\nThe Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and\r\nRosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight\r\nconnection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double\r\nmarriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs.\r\nVincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the\r\nchildren rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out\r\nof their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was a\r\nlittle hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in\r\nthe world, making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from\r\nan umbrella. Through all the stages of his education he had kept his\r\naffection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a\r\nsecond home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his\r\nfamily had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the\r\nVincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there\r\nwere nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old\r\nmanufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but\r\nequals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was\r\ndefined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible\r\ntheoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building\r\nbusiness, which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of\r\nsurveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time\r\nentirely for the benefit of his assignees, and had been living\r\nnarrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay\r\ntwenty shillings in the pound. He had now achieved this, and from all\r\nwho did not think it a bad precedent, his honorable exertions had won\r\nhim due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded\r\non esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete\r\ndinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth,\r\nand frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her\r\nbread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage;\r\nin which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions\r\nwas something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a\r\ncourier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better\r\noff needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.\r\nFeatherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had\r\nbeen converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should\r\nengage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small\r\nway.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to\r\nMrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing\r\nardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those\r\nwho belonged to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went with\r\nhis request. He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount\r\nof painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious\r\nabout his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had\r\nnot proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of\r\nFred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate\r\nfellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for\r\nanything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument. He was one of those\r\nrare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a\r\ncertain shame about his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them\r\nwillingly; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best\r\nmode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to\r\npreconceive those errors. If he had to blame any one, it was necessary\r\nfor him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various\r\ndiagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his\r\npocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work\r\nthan find fault with their doing. I fear he was a bad disciplinarian.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred stated the circumstances of his debt, his wish to meet it\r\nwithout troubling his father, and the certainty that the money would be\r\nforthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb pushed his\r\nspectacles upward, listened, looked into his favorite’s clear young\r\neyes, and believed him, not distinguishing confidence about the future\r\nfrom veracity about the past; but he felt that it was an occasion for a\r\nfriendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving his signature he\r\nmust give a rather strong admonition. Accordingly, he took the paper\r\nand lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached\r\nhis pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again,\r\nthen pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles\r\nagain, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy\r\neyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details\r\nfor once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb\r\nGarth), and said in a comfortable tone,—\r\n\r\n“It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees? And then,\r\nthese exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute jockeys to deal\r\nwith. You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his\r\nsignature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for\r\nwhatever he did in the way of business he did well. He contemplated the\r\nlarge well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his head a\r\ntrifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said\r\n“Good-by,” and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir\r\nJames Chettam’s new farm-buildings.\r\n\r\nEither because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the\r\nsignature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more\r\nconscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.\r\n\r\nSince it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which altered his\r\nview of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone’s\r\npresent of money was of importance enough to make his color come and\r\ngo, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a\r\nproportionate disappointment. His failure in passing his examination,\r\nhad made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his\r\nfather, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy\r\nhad sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with,\r\nFred should turn out and get his living how he could; and he had never\r\nyet quite recovered his good-humored tone to his son, who had\r\nespecially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did\r\nnot want to be a clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.”\r\nFred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with\r\nif his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr.\r\nFeatherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and apparent\r\nfondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct—just\r\nas when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act\r\nkleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of\r\nhis being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy\r\nwho had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be\r\ndone for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most\r\npeople viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness,\r\nwhat uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency, or what he\r\nwould do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable\r\ndepth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made,\r\nwas measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a\r\ndeficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment” or\r\nby luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the alleged\r\nborrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in getting the\r\nBulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to his father for\r\nmoney towards meeting his actual debt. Fred was keen enough to foresee\r\nthat anger would confuse distinctions, and that his denial of having\r\nborrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle’s will would be taken\r\nas a falsehood. He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious\r\naffair, and he had left another untold: in such cases the complete\r\nrevelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity. Now\r\nFred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often\r\nshrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called\r\nRosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with\r\na lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he\r\nwould even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was under strong\r\ninward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of\r\ndepositing the eighty pounds with his mother. It was a pity that he had\r\nnot at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he meant to make the sum\r\ncomplete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he had kept\r\ntwenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted\r\nby judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold—a\r\nvery poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman’s\r\ninfinite soul, with all the numerals at command.\r\n\r\nFred was not a gambler: he had not that specific disease in which the\r\nsuspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as\r\nnecessary as the dram to the drunkard; he had only the tendency to that\r\ndiffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is\r\ncarried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous\r\nimaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and\r\nhaving no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there\r\nmust be to others in going aboard with it. Hopefulness has a pleasure\r\nin making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is\r\ncertain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as\r\npossible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards,\r\nas he liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the\r\nbetter because he wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds’\r\nworth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green\r\nplot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the\r\nroadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no\r\nmoney at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with\r\nhis mother. The broken-winded horse which he rode represented a present\r\nwhich had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone:\r\nhis father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy’s own habits\r\nmaking him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was\r\nrather exasperating. This horse, then, was Fred’s property, and in his\r\nanxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a\r\npossession without which life would certainly be worth little. He made\r\nthe resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the\r\ndread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe\r\nof her opinion. He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be\r\nheld the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the\r\nmoney by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty\r\npounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly\r\nto balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some\r\ngood chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the\r\nless possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and the\r\nless reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and\r\nshot for bringing it down. He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge\r\nand with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly,\r\nhe should virtually get the benefit of their opinion. Before he set\r\nout, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother.\r\n\r\nMost of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with\r\nBambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley horse-fair,\r\nthought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an\r\nunwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he himself would have\r\nhad a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a\r\ngay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he\r\nrather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not\r\nbeen to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and\r\nunvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and\r\nHorrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh\r\nwould not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of\r\nNaming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other\r\nname than “pleasure” the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock\r\nmust certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with\r\nthem at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion\r\nin a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a\r\ndirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse\r\nin a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and\r\nvarious leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for\r\nthe sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit\r\nof these things was “gay.”\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which\r\noffered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave him a\r\nthrilling association with horses (enough to specify the hat-brim which\r\ntook the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending\r\ndownwards), and nature had given him a face which by dint of Mongolian\r\neyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his hat-brim in a\r\nmoderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable\r\nsceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a\r\nsusceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to\r\ncreate the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund\r\nof humor—too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable\r\ncrust,—and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate\r\nenough to know it, would be _the_ thing and no other. It is a\r\nphysiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more\r\npowerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his horse’s fetlock, turned\r\nsideways in his saddle, and watched the horse’s action for the space of\r\nthree minutes, then turned forward, twitched his own bridle, and\r\nremained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nThe part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective.\r\nA mixture of passions was excited in Fred—a mad desire to thrash\r\nHorrock’s opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the\r\nadvantage of his friendship. There was always the chance that Horrock\r\nmight say something quite invaluable at the right moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his\r\nideas without economy. He was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of\r\nas being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing, drinking, and\r\nbeating his wife. Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious\r\nman; but he regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might\r\nhave argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. He was\r\nundeniably a prosperous man, bore his drinking better than others bore\r\ntheir moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green\r\nbay-tree. But his range of conversation was limited, and like the fine\r\nold tune, “Drops of brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of\r\nreturning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a\r\nslight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to\r\nseveral circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in\r\nthe bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He knew some anecdotes\r\nabout the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses\r\nand Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its\r\npre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his\r\nmemory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and\r\nsold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without\r\nturning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of\r\npassionate asseveration, in which he would assist the imagination of\r\nhis hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.\r\nIn short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.\r\n\r\nFred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going to\r\nHoundsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly at\r\ntheir genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine\r\nopinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent\r\ncritics. It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a gratuitous\r\nflatterer. He had never before been so much struck with the fact that\r\nthis unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the\r\nroundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it.\r\n\r\n“You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me,\r\nVincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that\r\nchestnut, and you gave him for this brute. If you set him cantering, he\r\ngoes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in my\r\nlife, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; he\r\nused to drive him in his gig seven years ago, and he wanted me to take\r\nhim, but I said, ‘Thank you, Peg, I don’t deal in wind-instruments.’\r\nThat was what I said. It went the round of the country, that joke did.\r\nBut, what the hell! the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you said just now his was worse than mine,” said Fred, more\r\nirritable than usual.\r\n\r\n“I said a lie, then,” said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. “There wasn’t a\r\npenny to choose between ’em.”\r\n\r\nFred spurred his horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they\r\nslackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—\r\n\r\n“Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”\r\n\r\n“I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who required\r\nall the consciousness of being in gay company to support him; “I say\r\nhis trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”\r\n\r\nMr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he\r\nhad been a portrait by a great master.\r\n\r\nFred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on\r\nreflection he saw that Bambridge’s depreciation and Horrock’s silence\r\nwere both virtually encouraging, and indicated that they thought better\r\nof the horse than they chose to say.\r\n\r\nThat very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he\r\nsaw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse, but\r\nan opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in\r\nbringing with him his eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with\r\nMr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation\r\nabout parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond,\r\nimplying that it was a public character. For himself he only wanted a\r\nuseful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and\r\nto give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend’s stable at some little\r\ndistance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The\r\nfriend’s stable had to be reached through a back street where you might\r\nas easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim\r\nstreet of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against\r\ndisgust by brandy, as his companions were, but the hope of having at\r\nlast seen the horse that would enable him to make money was\r\nexhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first\r\nthing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain\r\nwith the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred\r\nfelt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the\r\nconstructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down Diamond in a\r\nway that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he\r\nhad not thought of buying it; every one who looked at the animal—even\r\nHorrock—was evidently impressed with its merit. To get all the\r\nadvantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how to draw\r\nyour inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally. The\r\ncolor of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know that\r\nLord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out for just such a horse. After\r\nall his running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the\r\nevening, when the farmer was absent, that he had seen worse horses go\r\nfor eighty pounds. Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over,\r\nbut when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man’s\r\nadmissions. And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse\r\nas worth something. The farmer had paused over Fred’s respectable\r\nthough broken-winded steed long enough to show that he thought it worth\r\nconsideration, and it seemed probable that he would take it, with\r\nfive-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In\r\nthat case Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least\r\neighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,\r\nand would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the\r\nbill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the\r\nutmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he was hurrying on his\r\nclothes in the morning, he saw so clearly the importance of not losing\r\nthis rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him,\r\nhe would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their\r\npurpose: he would have been aware that those deep hands held something\r\nelse than a young fellow’s interest. With regard to horses, distrust\r\nwas your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly\r\napplied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must\r\nbelieve in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is\r\nvirtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish\r\nreliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain,\r\nand even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the\r\ndappled gray, at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in\r\naddition—only five pounds more than he had expected to give.\r\n\r\nBut he felt a little worried and wearied, perhaps with mental debate,\r\nand without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse-fair, he set\r\nout alone on his fourteen miles’ journey, meaning to take it very\r\nquietly and keep his horse fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n“The offender’s sorrow brings but small relief\r\nTo him who wears the strong offence’s cross.”\r\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events\r\nat Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than he had known\r\nin his life before. Not that he had been disappointed as to the\r\npossible market for his horse, but that before the bargain could be\r\nconcluded with Lord Medlicote’s man, this Diamond, in which hope to the\r\namount of eighty pounds had been invested, had without the slightest\r\nwarning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking, had\r\njust missed killing the groom, and had ended in laming himself severely\r\nby catching his leg in a rope that overhung the stable-board. There was\r\nno more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after\r\nmarriage—which of course old companions were aware of before the\r\nceremony. For some reason or other, Fred had none of his usual\r\nelasticity under this stroke of ill-fortune: he was simply aware that\r\nhe had only fifty pounds, that there was no chance of his getting any\r\nmore at present, and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be\r\npresented in five days. Even if he had applied to his father on the\r\nplea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly\r\nthat his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the\r\nconsequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and deceit.\r\nHe was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other project than to\r\ngo straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad truth, carrying with him\r\nthe fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of his own\r\nhands. His father, being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the\r\naccident: when he did, he would storm about the vicious brute being\r\nbrought into his stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred\r\nwanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater. He took\r\nhis father’s nag, for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr.\r\nGarth, he would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact,\r\nit is probable that but for Mary’s existence and Fred’s love for her,\r\nhis conscience would have been much less active both in previously\r\nurging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself\r\nafter his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as\r\ndirectly and simply as he could. Even much stronger mortals than Fred\r\nVincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love\r\nbest. “The theatre of all my actions is fallen,” said an antique\r\npersonage when his chief friend was dead; and they are fortunate who\r\nget a theatre where the audience demands their best. Certainly it would\r\nhave made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth\r\nhad had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character.\r\n\r\nMr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house, which\r\nwas a little way outside the town—a homely place with an orchard in\r\nfront of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which\r\nbefore the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now\r\nsurrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder\r\nof our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends\r\nhave. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had four\r\nbrothers and one sister, were very fond of their old house, from which\r\nall the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing\r\nit by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and\r\nquinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant\r\nexpectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he\r\nshould probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom\r\nhe was rather more in awe than of her husband. Not that she was\r\ninclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her\r\npresent matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by\r\nover-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth,\r\nand learned self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what\r\nis unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her\r\nhusband’s virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his\r\nincapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences\r\ncheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in\r\nteapots or children’s frilling, and had never poured any pathetic\r\nconfidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr.\r\nGarth’s want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been\r\nlike other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or\r\neccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine\r\nMrs. Garth.” She was not without her criticism of them in return, being\r\nmore accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where\r\nis the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex,\r\nwhich in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the\r\nother hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings\r\nof men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it\r\nmust be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her\r\nresistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess\r\ninto housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her\r\nconsciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent\r\nwere above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family\r\ndinner, and darned all the stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in\r\na peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with\r\ntheir book or slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could\r\nmake an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without\r\nlooking,”—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows\r\nmight know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that, in\r\nshort, she might possess “education” and other good things ending in\r\n“tion,” and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a\r\nuseless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a\r\nfirm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from\r\nlooking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession\r\nwere uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary\r\nMrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her\r\noddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin.\r\n\r\nTowards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been\r\ndisposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not have\r\nexcused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included\r\nin that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex. But\r\nthis very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the\r\nharder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion. And the\r\ncircumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than\r\nhe had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some\r\nrepairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the\r\nkitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at\r\nonce there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side\r\nof that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and\r\ndough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy\r\nand girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their\r\nbooks and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other\r\nend of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly handling\r\nher pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,\r\nwhile she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views\r\nabout the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of multitude or\r\nsignifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She was of the same\r\ncurly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more\r\ndelicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a\r\nremarkable firmness of glance. In her snowy-frilled cap she reminded\r\none of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,\r\nbasket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter\r\nwould become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a\r\ndowry—the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a\r\nmalignant prophecy—“Such as I am, she will shortly be.”\r\n\r\n“Now let us go through that once more,” said Mrs. Garth, pinching an\r\napple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a\r\nheavy brow, from due attention to the lesson. “‘Not without regard to\r\nthe import of the word as conveying unity or plurality of idea’—tell me\r\nagain what that means, Ben.”\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her favorite ancient\r\npaths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried to hold her\r\n“Lindley Murray” above the waves.)\r\n\r\n“Oh—it means—you must think what you mean,” said Ben, rather peevishly.\r\n“I hate grammar. What’s the use of it?”\r\n\r\n“To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be\r\nunderstood,” said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. “Should you like\r\nto speak as old Job does?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Ben, stoutly; “it’s funnier. He says, ‘Yo goo’—that’s just\r\nas good as ‘You go.’”\r\n\r\n“But he says, ‘A ship’s in the garden,’ instead of ‘a sheep,’” said\r\nLetty, with an air of superiority. “You might think he meant a ship off\r\nthe sea.”\r\n\r\n“No, you mightn’t, if you weren’t silly,” said Ben. “How could a ship\r\noff the sea come there?”\r\n\r\n“These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of\r\ngrammar,” said Mrs. Garth. “That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs,\r\nBen; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of pasty. Job has only\r\nto speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or\r\nspeak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar\r\nthan he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong\r\nplaces, and instead of making people understand you, they would turn\r\naway from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t care, I should leave off,” said Ben, with a sense that\r\nthis was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.\r\n\r\n“I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\naccustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring.\r\nHaving finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and\r\nsaid, “Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about\r\nCincinnatus.”\r\n\r\n“I know! he was a farmer,” said Ben.\r\n\r\n“Now, Ben, he was a Roman—let _me_ tell,” said Letty, using her elbow\r\ncontentiously.\r\n\r\n“You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was ploughing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but before that—that didn’t come first—people wanted him,” said\r\nLetty.\r\n\r\n“Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first,” insisted Ben.\r\n“He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his\r\nadvice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my\r\nfather—couldn’t he, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,”\r\nsaid Letty, frowning. “Please, mother, tell Ben not to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Letty, I am ashamed of you,” said her mother, wringing out the caps\r\nfrom the tub. “When your brother began, you ought to have waited to see\r\nif he could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and\r\nfrowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I\r\nam sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so.” (Mrs.\r\nGarth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,\r\nand Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,\r\nthat of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) “Now,\r\nBen.”\r\n\r\n“Well—oh—well—why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were\r\nall blockheads, and—I can’t tell it just how you told it—but they\r\nwanted a man to be captain and king and everything—”\r\n\r\n“Dictator, now,” said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish\r\nto make her mother repent.\r\n\r\n“Very well, dictator!” said Ben, contemptuously. “But that isn’t a good\r\nword: he didn’t tell them to write on slates.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\ncarefully serious. “Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and\r\nopen it.”\r\n\r\nThe knock was Fred’s; and when Letty said that her father was not in\r\nyet, but that her mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative.\r\nHe could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth\r\nin the kitchen if she happened to be at work there. He put his arm\r\nround Letty’s neck silently, and led her into the kitchen without his\r\nusual jokes and caresses.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not\r\na feeling that she was given to express, and she only said, quietly\r\ncontinuing her work—\r\n\r\n“You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\n“I want to speak to Mr. Garth,” said Fred, not yet ready to say\r\nmore—“and to you also,” he added, after a little pause, for he had no\r\ndoubt that Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill, and he must in\r\nthe end speak of it before her, if not to her solely.\r\n\r\n“Caleb will be in again in a few minutes,” said Mrs. Garth, who\r\nimagined some trouble between Fred and his father. “He is sure not to\r\nbe long, because he has some work at his desk that must be done this\r\nmorning. Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?”\r\n\r\n“But we needn’t go on about Cincinnatus, need we?” said Ben, who had\r\ntaken Fred’s whip out of his hand, and was trying its efficiency on the\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n“No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to whip\r\npoor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him, Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Come, old boy, give it me,” said Fred, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\n“Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?” said Ben, rendering up the\r\nwhip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.\r\n\r\n“Not to-day—another time. I am not riding my own horse.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you see Mary to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so,” said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.\r\n\r\n“Tell her to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough, Ben! run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was\r\nteased.\r\n\r\n“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when\r\nthe children were gone and it was needful to say something that would\r\npass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.\r\nGarth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.\r\nGarth herself, give her the money and ride away.\r\n\r\n“One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not\r\ngetting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at a low\r\nebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for Alfred’s premium:\r\nI have ninety-two pounds. He can go to Mr. Hanmer’s now; he is just at\r\nthe right age.”\r\n\r\nThis did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink\r\nof losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent. “Young gentlemen\r\nwho go to college are rather more costly than that,” Mrs. Garth\r\ninnocently continued, pulling out the edging on a cap-border. “And\r\nCaleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a distinguished engineer: he\r\nwants to give the boy a good chance. There he is! I hear him coming in.\r\nWe will go to him in the parlor, shall we?”\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and was\r\nseated at his desk.\r\n\r\n“What! Fred, my boy!” he said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding his\r\npen still undipped; “you are here betimes.” But missing the usual\r\nexpression of cheerful greeting in Fred’s face, he immediately added,\r\n“Is there anything up at home?—anything the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give\r\nyou a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I\r\ncan’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the bill after all.\r\nI have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the\r\nhundred and sixty.”\r\n\r\nWhile Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid them on\r\nthe desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with the plain\r\nfact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs.\r\nGarth was mutely astonished, and looked at her husband for an\r\nexplanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—\r\n\r\n“Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was\r\nfor a hundred and sixty pounds. He made sure he could meet it himself.”\r\n\r\nThere was an evident change in Mrs. Garth’s face, but it was like a\r\nchange below the surface of water which remains smooth. She fixed her\r\neyes on Fred, saying—\r\n\r\n“I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he\r\nhas refused you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more difficulty;\r\n“but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless it were of use,\r\nI should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in the matter.”\r\n\r\n“It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his hesitating\r\nway, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,\r\n“Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now. You see, I have to cut\r\nout everything like a tailor with short measure. What can we do, Susan?\r\nI shall want every farthing we have in the bank. It’s a hundred and ten\r\npounds, the deuce take it!”\r\n\r\n“I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred’s\r\npremium,” said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear\r\nmight have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. “And I have\r\nno doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from her salary by this\r\ntime. She will advance it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least\r\ncalculating what words she should use to cut him the most effectively.\r\nLike the eccentric woman she was, she was at present absorbed in\r\nconsidering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could\r\nbe better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But she had made\r\nFred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse.\r\nCuriously enough, his pain in the affair beforehand had consisted\r\nalmost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonorable, and sink\r\nin the opinion of the Garths: he had not occupied himself with the\r\ninconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them,\r\nfor this exercise of the imagination on other people’s needs is not\r\ncommon with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought\r\nup in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is\r\nsomething irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But at\r\nthis moment he suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was robbing\r\ntwo women of their savings.\r\n\r\n“I shall certainly pay it all, Mrs. Garth—ultimately,” he stammered\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ultimately,” said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike to\r\nfine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram. “But\r\nboys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: they should be apprenticed\r\nat fifteen.” She had never been so little inclined to make excuses for\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n“I was the most in the wrong, Susan,” said Caleb. “Fred made sure of\r\nfinding the money. But I’d no business to be fingering bills. I suppose\r\nyou have looked all round and tried all honest means?” he added, fixing\r\nhis merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was too delicate to specify Mr.\r\nFeatherstone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have tried everything—I really have. I should have had a\r\nhundred and thirty pounds ready but for a misfortune with a horse which\r\nI was about to sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid\r\naway thirty with my old horse in order to get another which I was going\r\nto sell for eighty or more—I meant to go without a horse—but now it has\r\nturned out vicious and lamed itself. I wish I and the horses too had\r\nbeen at the devil, before I had brought this on you. There’s no one\r\nelse I care so much for: you and Mrs. Garth have always been so kind to\r\nme. However, it’s no use saying that. You will always think me a rascal\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nFred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he was\r\ngetting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his being sorry\r\nwas not of much use to the Garths. They could see him mount, and\r\nquickly pass through the gate.\r\n\r\n“I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,” said Mrs. Garth. “I would not have\r\nbelieved beforehand that he would have drawn you into his debts. I knew\r\nhe was extravagant, but I did not think that he would be so mean as to\r\nhang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the least afford to\r\nlose.”\r\n\r\n“I was a fool, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling. “But I should not\r\nhave gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such\r\nthings from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst off\r\nwithout telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had\r\nonly known I might have been ready with some better plan.”\r\n\r\n“You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,” said Caleb, looking feelingly at\r\nher. “I can’t abide your losing the money you’ve scraped together for\r\nAlfred.”\r\n\r\n“It is very well that I _had_ scraped it together; and it is you who\r\nwill have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must give\r\nup your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken to\r\nworking without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in that.\r\nAnd you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money she has.”\r\n\r\nCaleb had pushed his chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking his\r\nhead slowly, and fitting his finger-tips together with much nicety.\r\n\r\n“Poor Mary!” he said. “Susan,” he went on in a lowered tone, “I’m\r\nafraid she may be fond of Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! She always laughs at him; and he is not likely to think of her\r\nin any other than a brotherly way.”\r\n\r\nCaleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his spectacles, drew up\r\nhis chair to the desk, and said, “Deuce take the bill—I wish it was at\r\nHanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!”\r\n\r\nThe first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory\r\nexpression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But it\r\nwould be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the\r\nword “business,” the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious\r\nregard, in which he wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in\r\nits gold-fringed linen.\r\n\r\nCaleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value, the\r\nindispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which\r\nthe social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold of his\r\nimagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or\r\nkeel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the\r\nfurnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to\r\nhim; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating\r\nstar-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the\r\nwharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of\r\nmuscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these\r\nsights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the\r\npoets, had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers, a\r\nreligion without the aid of theology. His early ambition had been to\r\nhave as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was\r\npeculiarly dignified by him with the name of “business;” and though he\r\nhad only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his\r\nown teacher, he knew more of land, building, and mining than most of\r\nthe special men in the county.\r\n\r\nHis classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the\r\ncategories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these\r\nadvanced times. He divided them into “business, politics, preaching,\r\nlearning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against the last four;\r\nbut he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than\r\nhis own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he\r\nwould not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such\r\nclose contact with “business” as to get often honorably decorated with\r\nmarks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of\r\nthe woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other\r\nthan an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the\r\nsubject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good\r\npractical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of\r\nundertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was\r\nno spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him\r\nthat he was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of\r\nfirmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best\r\nland-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring\r\n(for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical\r\nintelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but\r\nhe had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of\r\nprofit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined\r\nto give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that\r\ntalent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he\r\ncould do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men\r\nwithin his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them,\r\nbecause he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined\r\nto charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and\r\n“lived in a small way.” However, they did not mind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n“Love seeketh not itself to please,\r\n    Nor for itself hath any care\r\nBut for another gives its ease\r\n    And builds a heaven in hell’s despair.\r\n. . . . . . .\r\nLove seeketh only self to please,\r\n    To bind another to its delight,\r\nJoys in another’s loss of ease,\r\n    And builds a hell in heaven’s despite.”\r\n—W. BLAKE: _Songs of Experience_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect\r\nhim, and when his uncle was not downstairs: in that case she might be\r\nsitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He left his horse in the yard\r\nto avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the parlor\r\nwithout other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in her\r\nusual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi’s recollections of Johnson, and\r\nlooked up with the fun still in her face. It gradually faded as she saw\r\nFred approach her without speaking, and stand before her with his elbow\r\non the mantel-piece, looking ill. She too was silent, only raising her\r\neyes to him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Mary,” he began, “I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.”\r\n\r\n“I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,” said Mary,\r\ntrying to smile, but feeling alarmed.\r\n\r\n“I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think me a\r\nliar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn’t care for\r\nyou, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you give me\r\ngood reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done. I would\r\nrather know the painful truth than imagine it.”\r\n\r\n“I owed money—a hundred and sixty pounds. I asked your father to put\r\nhis name to a bill. I thought it would not signify to him. I made sure\r\nof paying the money myself, and I have tried as hard as I could. And\r\nnow, I have been so unlucky—a horse has turned out badly—I can only pay\r\nfifty pounds. And I can’t ask my father for the money: he would not\r\ngive me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago.\r\nSo what can I do? And now your father has no ready money to spare, and\r\nyour mother will have to pay away her ninety-two pounds that she has\r\nsaved, and she says your savings must go too. You see what a—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, poor mother, poor father!” said Mary, her eyes filling with tears,\r\nand a little sob rising which she tried to repress. She looked straight\r\nbefore her and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at home\r\nbecoming present to her. He too remained silent for some moments,\r\nfeeling more miserable than ever. “I wouldn’t have hurt you for the\r\nworld, Mary,” he said at last. “You can never forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter whether I forgive you?” said Mary, passionately.\r\n“Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she has\r\nbeen earning by lessons for four years, that she might send Alfred to\r\nMr. Hanmer’s? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to say anything,” said Mary, more quietly, “and my anger\r\nis of no use.” She dried her eyes, threw aside her book, rose and\r\nfetched her sewing.\r\n\r\nFred followed her with his eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and\r\nin that way find access for his imploring penitence. But no! Mary could\r\neasily avoid looking upward.\r\n\r\n“I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she was\r\nseated again and sewing quickly. “I wanted to ask you, Mary—don’t you\r\nthink that Mr. Featherstone—if you were to tell him—tell him, I mean,\r\nabout apprenticing Alfred—would advance the money?”\r\n\r\n“My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for our\r\nmoney. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a\r\nhundred pounds. He rarely makes presents; he has never made presents to\r\nus. I am sure my father will not ask him for anything; and even if I\r\nchose to beg of him, it would be of no use.”\r\n\r\n“I am so miserable, Mary—if you knew how miserable I am, you would be\r\nsorry for me.”\r\n\r\n“There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But selfish\r\npeople always think their own discomfort of more importance than\r\nanything else in the world. I see enough of that every day.”\r\n\r\n“It is hardly fair to call me selfish. If you knew what things other\r\nyoung men do, you would think me a good way off the worst.”\r\n\r\n“I know that people who spend a great deal of money on themselves\r\nwithout knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish. They are always\r\nthinking of what they can get for themselves, and not of what other\r\npeople may lose.”\r\n\r\n“Any man may be unfortunate, Mary, and find himself unable to pay when\r\nhe meant it. There is not a better man in the world than your father,\r\nand yet he got into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?”\r\nsaid Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. “He never got into trouble by\r\nthinking of his own idle pleasures, but because he was always thinking\r\nof the work he was doing for other people. And he has fared hard, and\r\nworked hard to make good everybody’s loss.”\r\n\r\n“And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It\r\nis not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you have got any\r\npower over him, I think you might try and use it to make him better;\r\nbut that is what you never do. However, I’m going,” Fred ended,\r\nlanguidly. “I shall never speak to you about anything again. I’m very\r\nsorry for all the trouble I’ve caused—that’s all.”\r\n\r\nMary had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up. There is often\r\nsomething maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard experience\r\nhad wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that\r\nhard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred’s last words she\r\nfelt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother feels at the\r\nimagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child, which may lose\r\nitself and get harm. And when, looking up, her eyes met his dull\r\ndespairing glance, her pity for him surmounted her anger and all her\r\nother anxieties.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Fred, how ill you look! Sit down a moment. Don’t go yet. Let me\r\ntell uncle that you are here. He has been wondering that he has not\r\nseen you for a whole week.” Mary spoke hurriedly, saying the words that\r\ncame first without knowing very well what they were, but saying them in\r\na half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising as if to go away to\r\nMr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a\r\ngleam had come: he moved and stood in her way.\r\n\r\n“Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think the\r\nworst of me—will not give me up altogether.”\r\n\r\n“As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,” said Mary, in a\r\nmournful tone. “As if it were not very painful to me to see you an idle\r\nfrivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when others\r\nare working and striving, and there are so many things to be done—how\r\ncan you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is useful? And\r\nwith so much good in your disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great\r\ndeal.”\r\n\r\n“I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you\r\nlove me.”\r\n\r\n“I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be\r\nhanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him. What\r\nwill you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I suppose—just as\r\nidle, living in Mrs. Beck’s front parlor—fat and shabby, hoping\r\nsomebody will invite you to dinner—spending your morning in learning a\r\ncomic song—oh no! learning a tune on the flute.”\r\n\r\nMary’s lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she had asked\r\nthat question about Fred’s future (young souls are mobile), and before\r\nshe ended, her face had its full illumination of fun. To him it was\r\nlike the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him, and with a\r\npassive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand; but she slipped away\r\nquickly towards the door and said, “I shall tell uncle. You _must_ see\r\nhim for a moment or two.”\r\n\r\nFred secretly felt that his future was guaranteed against the\r\nfulfilment of Mary’s sarcastic prophecies, apart from that “anything”\r\nwhich he was ready to do if she would define it. He never dared in\r\nMary’s presence to approach the subject of his expectations from Mr.\r\nFeatherstone, and she always ignored them, as if everything depended on\r\nhimself. But if ever he actually came into the property, she must\r\nrecognize the change in his position. All this passed through his mind\r\nsomewhat languidly, before he went up to see his uncle. He stayed but a\r\nlittle while, excusing himself on the ground that he had a cold; and\r\nMary did not reappear before he left the house. But as he rode home, he\r\nbegan to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.\r\n\r\nWhen Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not\r\nsurprised, although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit, and\r\nwas not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old\r\nman, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law\r\nwhom he could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,\r\nhad nothing to ask of him, and understood all kinds of farming and\r\nmining business better than he did. But Mary had felt sure that her\r\nparents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she\r\nwould have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.\r\nAfter discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to\r\nbid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”\r\n\r\nShe took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,\r\nand setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned\r\nround to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him\r\nwith childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large\r\nbrows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when\r\nit is caressed. Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might\r\nsay, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it\r\nnatural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than\r\nother girls.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his hesitating\r\nway. “No very good news; but then it might be worse.”\r\n\r\n“About money, father? I think I know what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again, and put\r\nmy name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has got\r\nto part with her savings, that’s the worst of it, and even they won’t\r\nquite make things even. We wanted a hundred and ten pounds: your mother\r\nhas ninety-two, and I have none to spare in the bank; and she thinks\r\nthat you have some savings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would\r\ncome, father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white notes and\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\nMary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into her\r\nfather’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back,\r\nchild,—but how did you know about it?” said Caleb, who, in his\r\nunconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly\r\nconcerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary’s\r\naffections.\r\n\r\n“Fred told me this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Did he come on purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father, with\r\nhesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps. But I\r\nshould think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped up in\r\nhim, and so would your mother.”\r\n\r\n“And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but putting the\r\nback of her father’s hand against her cheek.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be\r\nsomething between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,\r\nMary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been pushing his\r\nhat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he turned his\r\neyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as she may, has got\r\nto put up with the life her husband makes for her. Your mother has had\r\nto put up with a good deal because of me.”\r\n\r\nMary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, nobody’s perfect, but”—here Mr. Garth shook his head to\r\nhelp out the inadequacy of words—“what I am thinking of is—what it must\r\nbe for a wife when she’s never sure of her husband, when he hasn’t got\r\na principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by\r\nothers than of getting his own toes pinched. That’s the long and the\r\nshort of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they\r\nknow what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only\r\nget together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you\r\nhave more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool:\r\nthere may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for\r\nhis daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s\r\neyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and\r\naffectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence. But\r\nI will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and\r\nwho goes on loitering away his time on the chance that others will\r\nprovide for him. You and my mother have taught me too much pride for\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right—that’s right. Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth, taking up\r\nhis hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.”\r\n\r\n“Father!” said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. “Take\r\npocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word\r\nbefore he closed the outer door on himself.\r\n\r\n“I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.\r\nFeatherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary\r\nreturned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age\r\nnow; you ought to be saving for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,” said\r\nMary, coldly.\r\n\r\nMr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary sort of\r\ngirl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought of another\r\nrejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If Fred Vincy\r\ncomes to-morrow, now, don’t you keep him chattering: let him come up to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nHe beats me and I rail at him: O worthy satisfaction! would it were\r\notherwise—that I could beat him while he railed at me.—_Troilus and\r\nCressida_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were\r\nquite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in\r\nsearch of Diamond, he had brought back not only a bad bargain in\r\nhorse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day\r\nor two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much\r\nworse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that, going into\r\nthe dining-room, he threw himself on the sofa, and in answer to his\r\nmother’s anxious question, said, “I feel very ill: I think you must\r\nsend for Wrench.”\r\n\r\nWrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a “slight\r\nderangement,” and did not speak of coming again on the morrow. He had a\r\ndue value for the Vincys’ house, but the wariest men are apt to be\r\ndulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through\r\ntheir business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was a\r\nsmall, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: he had a laborious\r\npractice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and\r\nhe was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to\r\nmeet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a\r\nrural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that\r\ndirection. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr.\r\nWrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time\r\nhad black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to\r\npoor Fred, who, however, unwilling as he said to believe that he was\r\n“in for an illness,” rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and\r\nwent down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in\r\nsitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but\r\nwas gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling’s changed\r\nlooks and general misery, began to cry and said she would send for Dr.\r\nSprague.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nonsense, mother! It’s nothing,” said Fred, putting out his hot\r\ndry hand to her, “I shall soon be all right. I must have taken cold in\r\nthat nasty damp ride.”\r\n\r\n“Mamma!” said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the dining-room\r\nwindows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate),\r\n“there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one. If I were you I\r\nwould call him in. He has cured Ellen Bulstrode. They say he cures\r\nevery one.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking\r\nonly of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was only two yards\r\noff on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the\r\nsudden sound of the sash, before she called to him. In two minutes he\r\nwas in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough\r\nto show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was\r\nbecoming.\r\n\r\nLydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind insisted\r\nwith remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially\r\non what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That\r\nthere might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but\r\nthe case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he\r\nwas convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,\r\nand that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed\r\nimmediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and\r\nprecautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs.\r\nVincy’s terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words\r\nas came most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.\r\nWrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr.\r\nPeacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should\r\nneglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of\r\nher understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s when they had the\r\nmeasles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he should. And if\r\nanything should happen—”\r\n\r\nHere poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe throat\r\nand good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of\r\nFred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now\r\ncame forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that\r\nthe symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form\r\nof fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately\r\nto the druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no\r\ntime, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.\r\n\r\n“But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t have my\r\nboy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank\r\nGod, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he’d better have let\r\nme die—if—if—”\r\n\r\n“I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate, really\r\nbelieving that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\n“Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming to her\r\nmother’s aid, and supporting her arm to lead her away.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not\r\ncare if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go on now,\r\nwhether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the\r\nhouse. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on\r\nThursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy was the best\r\nthing against infection. “I shall drink brandy,” added Mr. Vincy,\r\nemphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing\r\nwith blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.\r\nHe’d need have some luck by and by to make up for all this—else I don’t\r\nknow who’d have an eldest son.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip, “if you\r\ndon’t want him to be taken from me.”\r\n\r\n“It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,” said Mr. Vincy,\r\nmore mildly. “However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.”\r\n(What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever might somehow\r\nhave been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about\r\nhis—the Mayor’s—family.) “I’m the last man to give in to the cry about\r\nnew doctors, or new parsons either—whether they’re Bulstrode’s men or\r\nnot. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he will.”\r\n\r\nWrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he could\r\nbe in his offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a\r\ndisadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he\r\nhappens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country\r\npractitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point\r\nof honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He\r\ndid not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his temper was\r\nsomewhat tried on the occasion. He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say—\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?— To\r\ngo away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched\r\na corpse!”\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,\r\nand was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he heard\r\nWrench come in, and went into the hall to let him know what he thought.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the Mayor,\r\nwho of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and now\r\nbroadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever\r\nget unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought\r\nto be actionable, and are not so— that’s my opinion.”\r\n\r\nBut irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being\r\ninstructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,\r\ninwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in point of fact,”\r\nMr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,\r\nwhich would not wear. He swallowed his ire for the moment, but he\r\nafterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house\r\nmight be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody\r\non a professional matter. He reflected, with much probability on his\r\nside, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his\r\nungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his\r\nprofessional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw out\r\nbiting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get\r\nhimself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about\r\ncures was never got up by sound practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could\r\ndesire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but\r\nperilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the\r\nweather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst\r\nwhich all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself\r\nas much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and\r\nthe event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some\r\nsaid, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had\r\nthreatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her\r\nson. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate’s passing by was\r\nprovidential, that he was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that\r\nBulstrode was in the right to bring him forward. Many people believed\r\nthat Lydgate’s coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;\r\nand Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her\r\ninformation in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her\r\nknitting, had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son\r\nof Bulstrode’s, a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of\r\nevangelical laymen.\r\n\r\nShe one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother,\r\nwho did not fail to tell her son of it, observing—\r\n\r\n“I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be\r\nsorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”\r\n\r\n“Why, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, “you\r\nknow very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He never\r\nheard of Bulstrode before he came here.”\r\n\r\n“That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned, Camden,” said\r\nthe old lady, with an air of precision.—“But as to Bulstrode—the report\r\nmay be true of some other son.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nLet the high Muse chant loves Olympian:\r\nWe are but mortals, and must sing of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly\r\nfurniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me\r\nthis pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of\r\npolished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and\r\nmultitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a\r\nlighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will\r\nseem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round\r\nthat little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going\r\neverywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the\r\nflattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with\r\nan exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The\r\nscratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now\r\nabsent—of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a Providence of her own\r\nwho had kindly made her more charming than other girls, and who seemed\r\nto have arranged Fred’s illness and Mr. Wrench’s mistake in order to\r\nbring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would have been to\r\ncontravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to\r\nStone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do, especially\r\nsince Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless. Therefore, while\r\nMiss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning\r\nafter Fred’s illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave\r\npapa and mamma.\r\n\r\nPoor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;\r\nand Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account\r\nthan on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:\r\nher brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had\r\nalways been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye\r\nand plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that\r\nused most to interest her. Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be\r\nwandering out of her reach, tore her heart. After her first outburst\r\nagainst Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to\r\nLydgate. She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his\r\narm moaning out, “Save my boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been\r\ngood to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as\r\nif poor Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the\r\ndeepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man\r\nwhose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the\r\nbabe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born.\r\n\r\n“I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down with me\r\nand let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to the parlor\r\nwhere Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into\r\ntaking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her. There was a\r\nconstant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters. He\r\nalmost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to\r\nhim as to what she could do for mamma. Her presence of mind and\r\nadroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not\r\nwonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with\r\nhis interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was\r\npassed, and he began to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more\r\ndoubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,\r\nwould rather have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two\r\nconsultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there\r\nwas every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening he was at\r\nMr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became\r\nsimply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but\r\nconscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness\r\nhad made a festival for her tenderness.\r\n\r\nBoth father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when\r\nold Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must\r\nmake haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do\r\nwithout him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man himself was\r\ngetting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could\r\nlisten, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face, from\r\nwhich all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes\r\nseemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary—wondering\r\nwhat she felt about his illness. No word passed his lips; but “to hear\r\nwith eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of\r\nher heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any\r\nsacrifice in order to satisfy him.\r\n\r\n“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;\r\n“and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry anybody\r\nhe likes then.”\r\n\r\n“Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had made\r\nhim childish, and tears came as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly\r\nincredulous of any such refusal.\r\n\r\nShe never left Fred’s side when her husband was not in the house, and\r\nthus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone. Lydgate,\r\nnaturally, never thought of staying long with her, yet it seemed that\r\nthe brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that\r\npeculiar intimacy which consists in shyness. They were obliged to look\r\nat each other in speaking, and somehow the looking could not be carried\r\nthrough as the matter of course which it really was. Lydgate began to\r\nfeel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or\r\nanywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the\r\nnext day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their\r\neyes met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no help\r\nfor this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed\r\nto be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors\r\nno longer considered the house in quarantine, and when the chances of\r\nseeing Rosamond alone were very much reduced.\r\n\r\nBut that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the\r\nother is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to\r\nbe done away with. Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics is\r\napt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless\r\nit frankly recognizes a mutual fascination—which of course need not\r\nmean anything deep or serious. This was the way in which Rosamond and\r\nLydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse lively\r\nagain. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more music in\r\nthe drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s\r\nmayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by\r\nRosamond’s side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her\r\ncaptive—meaning, all the while, not to be her captive. The\r\npreposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a\r\nsatisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee\r\nagainst danger. This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and\r\ndid not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not\r\nnecessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never\r\nenjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being\r\nadmired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish\r\nflirtation from love, either in herself or in another. She seemed to be\r\nsailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her thoughts\r\nwere much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped\r\nwould by-and-by be vacant. She was quite determined, when she was\r\nmarried, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not\r\nagreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the drawing-room in\r\nher favorite house with various styles of furniture.\r\n\r\nCertainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he\r\nseemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his\r\nenchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant’s,\r\nand if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her\r\ntaste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.\r\nHow different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those\r\nyoung men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject\r\nwith striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,\r\nwhich of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\r\ngentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but\r\nembarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above\r\nthem, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.\r\nWhereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless\r\npoliteness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right\r\nclothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think\r\nabout them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he\r\napproached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\r\nthat she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware\r\nof all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been\r\njust as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant\r\nof humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest\r\nattitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without\r\ntoo precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not\r\none of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose\r\nbehavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being\r\nsteered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid\r\nforecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were\r\never discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the\r\ncontrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and\r\ndisapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been\r\ndetected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have\r\ndisbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any\r\nunbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct\r\nsentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\r\nalbum for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\r\nirresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair\r\nevil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or\r\nmercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something\r\nnecessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the\r\nhabit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew\r\nto fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her\r\nelegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many\r\narts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent\r\n(Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and\r\namiability.\r\n\r\nLydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and there was\r\nno constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in\r\ntheir eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for\r\nthem, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third\r\nperson; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third\r\nperson need have been excluded. In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was\r\nsecure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not\r\nlove and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?\r\nReally, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great\r\nbores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:\r\nwhat was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the\r\nBulstrodes’; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and\r\nMrs. Bulstrode’s _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the\r\nnothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the\r\nconsciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a\r\nsufficient relief from the weight of her husband’s invariable\r\nseriousness. The Vincys’ house, with all its faults, was the pleasanter\r\nby contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to look at as a\r\nhalf-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the\r\nrefined amusement of man.\r\n\r\nBut he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success with Miss\r\nVincy. One evening he came into the drawing-room rather late, when\r\nseveral other visitors were there. The card-table had drawn off the\r\nelders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,\r\nthough not one of its leading minds) was in _tête-à-tête_ with\r\nRosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,” the gorgeous watered-silk\r\npublication which marked modern progress at that time; and he\r\nconsidered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look\r\nover it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny\r\ncopper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic\r\nverses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was\r\ngracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in\r\nart and literature as a medium for “paying addresses”—the very thing to\r\nplease a nice girl. He had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible,\r\nfor being satisfied with his own appearance. To superficial observers\r\nhis chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being\r\ngradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about\r\nthe fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.\r\n\r\n“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He\r\nkept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it rather\r\nlanguishingly.\r\n\r\n“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said\r\nRosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s\r\nhands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with\r\nher tatting all the while.\r\n\r\n“I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,\r\nventuring to look from the portrait to its rival.\r\n\r\n“I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond, feeling\r\nsure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.\r\n\r\nBut now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached\r\nRosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the\r\nother side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer towards\r\nthe cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s\r\npresence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.\r\n\r\n“What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands. “Mamma had\r\ngiven you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?”\r\n\r\n“As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to Stone\r\nCourt, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so changed,”\r\nshe added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate\r\nas our guardian angel during this illness.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards\r\nhim and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin,\r\nas if in wonderment at human folly.\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with bland\r\nneutrality.\r\n\r\n“I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings or the\r\nwriting here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he\r\nturned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in\r\nno time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as\r\nRosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did\r\nyou ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the Elizabethans used to\r\nsay? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer for\r\nit the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.”\r\n\r\n“You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond, keeping her\r\namusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with\r\nadmiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.\r\n\r\n“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at\r\nall events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. “This is the\r\nfirst time I have heard it called silly.”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,”\r\nsaid Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect you know\r\nnothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond herself was not\r\nwithout relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit\r\nherself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that\r\nanything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.\r\n\r\n“But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said young\r\nPlymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and\r\npushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it\r\nwill last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems by heart.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond, “because then\r\nI might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr. Ned,\r\npurposely caustic.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with\r\nexasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth knowing by the\r\nfact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”\r\n\r\nYoung Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that\r\nLydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever\r\nbeen his ill-fortune to meet.\r\n\r\n“How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you see that\r\nyou have given offence?”\r\n\r\n“What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think about it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came\r\nhere—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I listen\r\nto her willingly?”\r\n\r\nTo Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.\r\nThat they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her\r\nmind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the\r\nnecessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the\r\ncounter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a\r\nshadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of\r\nshrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond’s\r\nidea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue\r\neyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which\r\ngets melted without knowing it.\r\n\r\nThat evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a\r\nprocess of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he\r\nwrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual. The reveries\r\nfrom which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal\r\nconstructions of something else than Rosamond’s virtues, and the\r\nprimitive tissue was still his fair unknown. Moreover, he was beginning\r\nto feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between\r\nhim and the other medical men, which was likely to become more\r\nmanifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was\r\nabout to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his\r\nnon-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced\r\nby the impression he had produced in other quarters. Only a few days\r\nlater, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and\r\nhad got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite\r\nprotected her from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on\r\nhorseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance\r\nwhere Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of\r\nthis kind. The servant was Sir James Chettam’s, and the house was\r\nLowick Manor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_. All times are good to seek your wedded home\r\n    Bringing a mutual delight.\r\n\r\n2_d Gent_. Why, true.\r\n    The calendar hath not an evil day\r\n    For souls made one by love, and even death\r\n    Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves\r\n    While they two clasped each other, and foresaw\r\n    No life apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at\r\nLowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was falling as they\r\ndescended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed from\r\nher dressing-room into the blue-green boudoir that we know of, she saw\r\nthe long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth, and\r\nspreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky. The\r\ndistant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of\r\ncloud. The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she\r\nsaw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his\r\nghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the\r\nbookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright\r\nfire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous\r\nrenewal of life and glow—like the figure of Dorothea herself as she\r\nentered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.\r\n\r\nShe was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can\r\nglow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel\r\neyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had a breathing\r\nwhiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to\r\nwind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a\r\ntenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which\r\nkept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.\r\nAs she laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she\r\nunconsciously kept her hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking\r\nout on the still, white enclosure which made her visible world.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in\r\nthe library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker. By-and-by Celia\r\nwould come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through\r\nthe next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in\r\ncontinuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the\r\nexcitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy\r\nineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect. The\r\nduties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed\r\nto be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled\r\nlandscape. The clear heights where she expected to walk in full\r\ncommunion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the\r\ndelicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken\r\ninto uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the\r\ndays begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her\r\nhusband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had\r\npreconceived them; but somehow—still somehow. In this solemnly pledged\r\nunion of her life, duty would present itself in some new form of\r\ninspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor—there was\r\nthe stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where everything\r\nwas done for her and none asked for her aid—where the sense of\r\nconnection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up\r\npainfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims\r\nthat would have shaped her energies.— “What shall I do?” “Whatever you\r\nplease, my dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left\r\noff learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated\r\npiano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative\r\noccupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive\r\nliberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of\r\nunchecked tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a\r\nmoral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless,\r\nnarrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books,\r\nand the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be\r\nvanishing from the daylight.\r\n\r\nIn the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the\r\ndreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from\r\nthe window she walked round the room. The ideas and hopes which were\r\nliving in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months\r\nbefore were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge\r\ntransient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a\r\nlower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry,\r\nthe struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and\r\nshrinking away from her. Each remembered thing in the room was\r\ndisenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering\r\ngaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw\r\nsomething which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the\r\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate\r\nmarriage—of Will Ladislaw’s grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it\r\nwas alive now—the delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong\r\nlook, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who\r\nthought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to be\r\na mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful\r\nsilence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to\r\nhave passed over since she first looked at this miniature! She felt a\r\nnew companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and could see\r\nhow she was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known some\r\ndifficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin\r\nseemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light,\r\nthe face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which\r\ntells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the\r\nslightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.\r\nThe vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt\r\nherself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up\r\nas if she were again talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile\r\ndisappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad—how dreadful!”\r\n\r\nShe rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,\r\nwith the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if\r\nshe could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.\r\nCasaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning’s\r\ngloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nBut when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming\r\nup, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and\r\ncongratulations with Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\n“Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,\r\nwhose arms encircled her, and said no more. I think they both cried a\r\nlittle in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing\r\nher forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness, frescos, the\r\nantique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant to have you back\r\nagain, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is a\r\nlittle pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know. Studying hard in his\r\nholidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one time”—Mr.\r\nBrooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but had turned his face to Mr.\r\nCasaubon—“about topography, ruins, temples—I thought I had a clew, but\r\nI saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of it. You may\r\ngo any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with some\r\nanxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might\r\nbe aware of signs which she had not noticed.\r\n\r\n“Nothing to alarm you, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, observing her\r\nexpression. “A little English beef and mutton will soon make a\r\ndifference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait\r\nof Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But Aquinas,\r\nnow—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody read Aquinas?”\r\n\r\n“He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said Mr.\r\nCasaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.\r\n\r\n“You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?” said Dorothea, coming\r\nto the rescue.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you, you\r\nknow. I leave it all to her.”\r\n\r\nThe blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated\r\nthere in a pelisse exactly like her sister’s, surveying the cameos with\r\na placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said Celia,\r\nwith her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the\r\nsmallest occasions.\r\n\r\n“It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said Dorothea,\r\nquietly. No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey\r\nto Rome.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when\r\nthey are married. She says they get tired to death of each other, and\r\ncan’t quarrel comfortably, as they would at home. And Lady Chettam says\r\nshe went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed again and again—seemed\r\n\r\n“To come and go with tidings from the heart,\r\nAs it a running messenger had been.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.\r\n\r\n“Celia! has something happened?” said Dorothea, in a tone full of\r\nsisterly feeling. “Have you really any great news to tell me?”\r\n\r\n“It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but me for\r\nSir James to talk to,” said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,” said Dorothea,\r\ntaking her sister’s face between her hands, and looking at her half\r\nanxiously. Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.\r\n\r\n“It was only three days ago,” said Celia. “And Lady Chettam is very\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\n“And you are very happy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We are not going to be married yet. Because every thing is to be\r\ngot ready. And I don’t want to be married so very soon, because I think\r\nit is nice to be engaged. And we shall be married all our lives after.”\r\n\r\n“I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty. Sir James is a good,\r\nhonorable man,” said Dorothea, warmly.\r\n\r\n“He has gone on with the cottages, Dodo. He will tell you about them\r\nwhen he comes. Shall you be glad to see him?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I shall. How can you ask me?”\r\n\r\n“Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,” said Celia,\r\nregarding Mr. Casaubon’s learning as a kind of damp which might in due\r\ntime saturate a neighboring body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nI found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate\r\nparadoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort.—GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why\r\nalways Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with\r\nregard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our\r\neffort at understanding being given to the young skins that look\r\nblooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will\r\nknow the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.\r\nIn spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,\r\nand the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,\r\nMr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was\r\nspiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing\r\nexceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and\r\nconsiders an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him\r\nthat he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he\r\nhad reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should\r\nexpect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the younger the\r\nbetter, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his\r\nown, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good\r\nunderstanding. On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements,\r\nand he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in return, he\r\nshould receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of\r\nhimself which seemed so urgently required of a man—to the sonneteers of\r\nthe sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer\r\nhad insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he\r\nhad not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he\r\nhad always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that\r\nhe was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting\r\ndimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more\r\ntime in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind\r\nby the years.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more\r\nthan he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would\r\nenable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.\r\nCasaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. (Mr.\r\nCasaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a\r\npowerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the\r\nwife he needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely\r\nappreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her\r\nhusband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of\r\nMiss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could\r\nhardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a\r\nman should think as much about his own qualifications for making a\r\ncharming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As\r\nif a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband! Or as\r\nif he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own\r\nperson!— When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only\r\nnatural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nHe had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To\r\nknow intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an\r\nenthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,\r\nand his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too\r\nlanguid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it\r\nwent on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking\r\nof its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind\r\nwhich shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known:\r\nit was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to\r\nspare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in\r\nsmall currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\r\nscrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a\r\nsevere self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor\r\naccording to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized\r\nopinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of\r\nmaking his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon\r\nhis mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga” as he called them—by which he\r\ntested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march,\r\nwere far from having been seen in all their significance. He suspected\r\nthe Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful doubt as to\r\nwhat was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and\r\nbitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer\r\nof that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer\r\nof Mr. Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory.\r\nThese were heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that\r\nmelancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive\r\nclaim: even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his\r\nown authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in\r\nimmortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten\r\nKey to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an\r\nuneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\r\nenjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be\r\nliberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully\r\npossessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness\r\nrapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a\r\npassion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and\r\nuninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a\r\ndean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that\r\nbehind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our\r\npoor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less\r\nunder anxious control.\r\n\r\nTo this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to\r\nsensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing\r\nhappiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we\r\nhave seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness\r\nthat the new bliss was not blissful to him. Inclination yearned back to\r\nits old, easier custom. And the deeper he went in domesticity the more\r\ndid the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety\r\npredominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and\r\nerudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\r\nrequirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\r\nall requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study,\r\naccording to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he\r\nwas always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it\r\nmight never have begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of\r\ncourse that she should take her place at an early hour in the library\r\nand have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work\r\nhad been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate\r\nintention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some\r\nlately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby\r\ncertain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were\r\nextensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were\r\nactually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by\r\nBrasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental\r\nproductions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made\r\ndifficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of\r\ndialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain. And from\r\nthe first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was\r\nuncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a\r\npoisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a\r\ndedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal\r\nkingdom among the _viros nullo ævo perituros_, a mistake which would\r\ninfallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and\r\nmight even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to\r\nsay a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where\r\nhe had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to\r\nLowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the\r\ndrawing-room expecting Sir James.\r\n\r\nDorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she\r\nsaw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.\r\nShe was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone\r\nwhich implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty—\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one\r\naddressed to me.”\r\n\r\nIt was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in a tone\r\nof pleased surprise. “But,” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I can\r\nimagine what he has written to you about.”\r\n\r\n“You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon, severely\r\npointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But I may as well\r\nsay beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a\r\nvisit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of\r\ncomplete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto\r\ninevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes\r\ntheir presence a fatigue.”\r\n\r\nThere had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband\r\nsince that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces\r\nin her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to\r\nincur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered anticipation\r\nthat she could desire visits which might be disagreeable to her\r\nhusband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish complaint\r\non her part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it\r\nhad been resented. Dorothea had thought that she could have been\r\npatient with John Milton, but she had never imagined him behaving in\r\nthis way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly\r\nundiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that “new-born babe” which was\r\nby-and-by to rule many a storm within her, did not “stride the blast”\r\non this occasion. With her first words, uttered in a tone that shook\r\nhim, she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the\r\nflash of her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?\r\nYou speak to me as if I were something you had to contend against. Wait\r\nat least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours.”\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, you are hasty,” answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of\r\nwifehood—unless she had been pale and featureless and taken everything\r\nfor granted.\r\n\r\n“I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions\r\nabout my feeling,” said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not\r\ndissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to\r\napologize to her.\r\n\r\n“We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I have\r\nneither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his\r\nwriting, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be\r\nwritten in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning\r\naway wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a\r\ndiscussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own\r\nside is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.\r\n\r\nDorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s\r\nwriting-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation\r\nwithin her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away\r\nany trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean\r\ncupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her\r\nhusband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had\r\ncaused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her hand did\r\nnot tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had\r\nbeen given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her\r\nletters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction\r\nof the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to\r\nunderstand, more clearly than usual. In her indignation there was a\r\nsense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of\r\nstroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice\r\npronouncing the once “affable archangel” a poor creature.\r\n\r\nThere had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had\r\nnot looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a\r\nbook on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library\r\nsteps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress. She\r\nstarted up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in\r\ngreat straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow\r\nand said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm—\r\n\r\n“Can you lean on me, dear?”\r\n\r\nHe was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,\r\nunable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he descended\r\nthe three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had\r\ndrawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed\r\nhelpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and\r\npresently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and\r\nwas gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met\r\nin the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had “had a fit in the\r\nlibrary.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his\r\nimmediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to\r\nparticularize, it seemed to him that “fits” would have been the\r\ndefinite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the butler,\r\nwhether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his master\r\nto want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a\r\nphysician?\r\n\r\nWhen Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make\r\nsome signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction\r\nfrom her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now\r\nrose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My mother has\r\ncalled him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever. She has had a\r\npoor opinion of the physicians since my father’s death.”\r\n\r\nDorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of\r\napproval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon, for\r\nthe messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr. Lydgate,\r\nmet him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to\r\nMiss Vincy.\r\n\r\nCelia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir\r\nJames told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no longer considered\r\nthe illness a fit, but still something “of that nature.”\r\n\r\n“Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much grieved as\r\nher own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands were clasped,\r\nand enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.\r\n“It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did\r\nlike him. And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he\r\nought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him—do you think\r\nthey would?”\r\n\r\n“I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said Sir\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n“Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she\r\nnever will.”\r\n\r\n“She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He had\r\njust had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea\r\nstretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and looking at him\r\nwith unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much penitence there was\r\nin the sorrow.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,\r\nbut _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. “Shall I go to her?\r\nCould I help her, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate\r\ncomes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay long.”\r\n\r\nWhile Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had\r\noriginally felt about Dorothea’s engagement, and feeling a revival of\r\nhis disgust at Mr. Brooke’s indifference. If Cadwallader—if every one\r\nelse had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage\r\nmight have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly\r\ndecide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her. Sir James\r\nhad long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was\r\nsatisfied with his engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature\r\n(was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of\r\nold chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its\r\ndeath had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a\r\nconsecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly friend,\r\ninterpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nQui veut délasser hors de propos, lasse.—PASCAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and\r\nin a few days began to recover his usual condition. But Lydgate seemed\r\nto think the case worth a great deal of attention. He not only used his\r\nstethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at\r\nthat time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him. To Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s questions about himself, he replied that the source of the\r\nillness was the common error of intellectual men—a too eager and\r\nmonotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate\r\nwork, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one\r\noccasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader\r\ndid, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n“In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second\r\nchildhood,” said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. “These\r\nthings,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation\r\nas tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an\r\nunsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to\r\nkeep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit\r\nto be mildly bored rather than to go on working.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Brooke. “Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you\r\nin the evenings. And shuttlecock, now—I don’t know a finer game than\r\nshuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure,\r\nyour eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you\r\nknow. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I\r\nalways think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you\r\nlight things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are\r\na little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.\r\nI remember they made me laugh uncommonly—there’s a droll bit about a\r\npostilion’s breeches. We have no such humor now. I have gone through\r\nall these things, but they might be rather new to you.”\r\n\r\n“As new as eating thistles,” would have been an answer to represent Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s feelings. But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to\r\nhis wife’s uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned\r\nhad “served as a resource to a certain order of minds.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside\r\nthe door, “Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a\r\nloss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is\r\nsomething very deep indeed—in the line of research, you know. I would\r\nnever give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is tied\r\na little tight. If they would make him a bishop, now!—he did a very\r\ngood pamphlet for Peel. He would have more movement then, more show; he\r\nmight get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs. Casaubon.\r\nShe is clever enough for anything, is my niece. Tell her, her husband\r\nwants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.”\r\n\r\nWithout Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to\r\nDorothea. She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his\r\npleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be\r\nenlivened, but she was usually by her husband’s side, and the\r\nunaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about\r\nwhatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was\r\ninclined to watch. He said to himself that he was only doing right in\r\ntelling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he\r\ncertainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk\r\nconfidentially with her. A medical man likes to make psychological\r\nobservations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too\r\neasily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set\r\nat nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous\r\nprediction, and he meant now to be guarded.\r\n\r\nHe asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he\r\nwas going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from\r\ntheir struggle with the March wind. When Lydgate begged to speak with\r\nher alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the\r\nnearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to\r\nsay about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she had entered this room\r\nsince her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to\r\nopen the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from the\r\nnarrow upper panes of the windows.\r\n\r\n“You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the\r\nmiddle of the room. “Since you forbade books, the library has been out\r\nof the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is\r\nhe not making progress?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he is\r\nalready nearly in his usual state of health.”\r\n\r\n“You do not fear that the illness will return?” said Dorothea, whose\r\nquick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate’s tone.\r\n\r\n“Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,” said Lydgate.\r\n“The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be\r\ndesirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon’s account, lest he should\r\nin any way strain his nervous power.”\r\n\r\n“I beseech you to speak quite plainly,” said Dorothea, in an imploring\r\ntone. “I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did\r\nnot know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act\r\ndifferently.” The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they\r\nwere the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and\r\nthrowing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of\r\nformality where a great question of destiny was concerned.\r\n\r\n“What you say now justifies my own view,” said Lydgate. “I think it is\r\none’s function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far\r\nas possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is\r\nprecisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce\r\nupon. He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much\r\nworse health than he has had hitherto.”\r\n\r\nDorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a\r\nlow voice, “You mean if we are very careful.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against\r\nexcessive application.”\r\n\r\n“He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,” said Dorothea,\r\nwith a quick prevision of that wretchedness.\r\n\r\n“I am aware of that. The only course is to try by all means, direct and\r\nindirect, to moderate and vary his occupations. With a happy\r\nconcurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger\r\nfrom that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the\r\ncause of his late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the\r\ndisease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in\r\nwhich death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which\r\nmight be affected by such an issue.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had\r\nbeen turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that\r\nher mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of\r\nscenes and motives.\r\n\r\n“Help me, pray,” she said, at last, in the same low voice as before.\r\n“Tell me what I can do.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of foreign travel? You have been lately in Rome, I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\nThe memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new\r\ncurrent that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that would not do—that would be worse than anything,” she said\r\nwith a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.\r\n“Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.”\r\n\r\n“I wish that I could have spared you this pain,” said Lydgate, deeply\r\ntouched, yet wondering about her marriage. Women just like Dorothea had\r\nnot entered into his traditions.\r\n\r\n“It was right of you to tell me. I thank you for telling me the truth.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten\r\nMr. Casaubon himself. I think it desirable for him to know nothing more\r\nthan that he must not overwork himself, and must observe certain rules.\r\nAnxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable condition\r\nfor him.”\r\n\r\nLydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time,\r\nunclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her. He was\r\nbowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone\r\nwould have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and\r\ndeath. Advise me. Think what I can do. He has been laboring all his\r\nlife and looking forward. He minds about nothing else.— And I mind\r\nabout nothing else—”\r\n\r\nFor years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him by\r\nthis involuntary appeal—this cry from soul to soul, without other\r\nconsciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same\r\nembroiled medium, the same troublous fitfully illuminated life. But\r\nwhat could he say now except that he should see Mr. Casaubon again\r\nto-morrow?\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Dorothea’s tears gushed forth, and relieved her\r\nstifling oppression. Then she dried her eyes, reminded that her\r\ndistress must not be betrayed to her husband; and looked round the room\r\nthinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual,\r\nsince Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter. On his\r\nwriting-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the\r\nmorning when he was taken ill, and among them, as Dorothea well\r\nremembered, there were young Ladislaw’s letters, the one addressed to\r\nher still unopened. The associations of these letters had been made the\r\nmore painful by that sudden attack of illness which she felt that the\r\nagitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on: it would\r\nbe time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her, and\r\nshe had had no inclination to fetch them from the library. But now it\r\noccurred to her that they should be put out of her husband’s sight:\r\nwhatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them, he\r\nmust, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she ran her eyes first\r\nover the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it\r\nwould be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.\r\n\r\nWill wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his obligations to Mr.\r\nCasaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was\r\nplain that if he were not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited\r\nrascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks\r\nwould be like saying, “I am honest.” But Will had come to perceive that\r\nhis defects—defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed\r\nto—needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his\r\nrelative’s generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He\r\ntrusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible,\r\nby showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was\r\nindebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards\r\nhimself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He was\r\ncoming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were\r\nobliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His friend\r\nNaumann had desired him to take charge of the “Dispute”—the picture\r\npainted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon’s,\r\nWill would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the\r\nPoste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if\r\nnecessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He enclosed a\r\nletter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art,\r\nbegun with her in Rome.\r\n\r\nOpening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation\r\nof his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy\r\nneutral delight in things as they were—an outpouring of his young\r\nvivacity which it was impossible to read just now. She had immediately\r\nto consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still\r\ntime perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick. Dorothea ended by\r\ngiving the letter to her uncle, who was still in the house, and begging\r\nhim to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his\r\nhealth would not allow the reception of any visitors.\r\n\r\nNo one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his only\r\ndifficulty was to write a short one, and his ideas in this case\r\nexpanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings. He had\r\nsimply said to Dorothea—\r\n\r\n“To be sure, I will write, my dear. He’s a very clever young\r\nfellow—this young Ladislaw—I dare say will be a rising young man. It’s\r\na good letter—marks his sense of things, you know. However, I will tell\r\nhim about Casaubon.”\r\n\r\nBut the end of Mr. Brooke’s pen was a thinking organ, evolving\r\nsentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his mind\r\ncould well overtake them. It expressed regrets and proposed remedies,\r\nwhich, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously\r\nworded—surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he\r\nhad never before thought of. In this case, his pen found it such a pity\r\nyoung Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that\r\ntime, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully,\r\nand that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings\r\ntogether—it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting\r\nin life with a stock of ideas—that by the end of the second page it had\r\npersuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be\r\nreceived at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange. Why not? They could find\r\na great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar\r\ngrowth—the political horizon was expanding, and—in short, Mr. Brooke’s\r\npen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that\r\nimperfectly edited organ the “Middlemarch Pioneer.” While Mr. Brooke\r\nwas sealing this letter, he felt elated with an influx of dim\r\nprojects:—a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the “Pioneer”\r\npurchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents\r\nutilized—who knew what might come of it all? Since Celia was going to\r\nmarry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at\r\ntable with him, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nBut he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the\r\nletter, for she was engaged with her husband, and—in fact, these things\r\nwere of no importance to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nHow will you know the pitch of that great bell\r\nToo large for you to stir? Let but a flute\r\nPlay ’neath the fine-mixed metal: listen close\r\nTill the right note flows forth, a silvery rill:\r\nThen shall the huge bell tremble—then the mass\r\nWith myriad waves concurrent shall respond\r\nIn low soft unison.\r\n\r\n\r\nLydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid\r\nsome emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for that\r\nformal studious man thirty years older than herself.\r\n\r\n“Of course she is devoted to her husband,” said Rosamond, implying a\r\nnotion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the\r\nprettiest possible for a woman; but she was thinking at the same time\r\nthat it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with\r\na husband likely to die soon. “Do you think her very handsome?”\r\n\r\n“She certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,” said\r\nLydgate.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it would be unprofessional,” said Rosamond, dimpling. “But\r\nhow your practice is spreading! You were called in before to the\r\nChettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. “But I don’t\r\nreally like attending such people so well as the poor. The cases are\r\nmore monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more\r\ndeferentially to nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Not more than in Middlemarch,” said Rosamond. “And at least you go\r\nthrough wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,” said Lydgate, just bending\r\nhis head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger her delicate\r\nhandkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule, as if to enjoy its\r\nscent, while he looked at her with a smile.\r\n\r\nBut this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the\r\nflower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely. It was not more\r\npossible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two\r\npeople persistently flirting could by no means escape from “the various\r\nentanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things\r\nseverally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and she was\r\nperhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now\r\nMrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little\r\nwhile at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying\r\nold Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a\r\nless tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nAunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to\r\nsee Rosamond, now she was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly\r\nfeeling for her brother; always thinking that he might have married\r\nbetter, but wishing well to the children. Now Mrs. Bulstrode had a\r\nlong-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale. They had nearly the same\r\npreferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and\r\nclergymen; they confided their little troubles of health and household\r\nmanagement to each other, and various little points of superiority on\r\nMrs. Bulstrode’s side, namely, more decided seriousness, more\r\nadmiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to\r\ngive color to their conversation without dividing them—well-meaning\r\nwomen both, knowing very little of their own motives.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to\r\nsay that she could not stay longer, because she was going to see poor\r\nRosamond.\r\n\r\n“Why do you say ‘poor Rosamond’?” said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed\r\nsharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.\r\n\r\n“She is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness. The\r\nmother, you know, had always that levity about her, which makes me\r\nanxious for the children.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,” said Mrs. Plymdale, with\r\nemphasis, “I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr. Bulstrode\r\nwould be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything\r\nto put Mr. Lydgate forward.”\r\n\r\n“Selina, what do you mean?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.\r\n\r\n“Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned’s sake,” said Mrs. Plymdale.\r\n“He could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people\r\ncan; but I should wish him to look elsewhere. Still a mother has\r\nanxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.\r\nBesides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of\r\nstrangers coming into a town.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Selina,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with a little emphasis in\r\nher turn. “Mr. Bulstrode was a stranger here at one time. Abraham and\r\nMoses were strangers in the land, and we are told to entertain\r\nstrangers. And especially,” she added, after a slight pause, “when they\r\nare unexceptionable.”\r\n\r\n“I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\n“Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece\r\nof mine marrying your son.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,” said Mrs.\r\nPlymdale, who had never before given all her confidence to “Harriet” on\r\nthis subject. “No young man in Middlemarch was good enough for her: I\r\nhave heard her mother say as much. That is not a Christian spirit, I\r\nthink. But now, from all I hear, she has found a man as proud as\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.\r\nLydgate?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her own\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible you don’t know, Harriet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never\r\nhear any. You see so many people that I don’t see. Your circle is\r\nrather different from ours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode’s great favorite—and yours\r\ntoo, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him for\r\nKate, when she is a little older.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe there can be anything serious at present,” said Mrs.\r\nBulstrode. “My brother would certainly have told me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see\r\nMiss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to be engaged.\r\nHowever, it is not my business. Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?”\r\n\r\nAfter this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly\r\nweighted. She was herself handsomely dressed, but she noticed with a\r\nlittle more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and\r\nmet her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.\r\nBulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and had none\r\nof her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest glance and\r\nused no circumlocution.\r\n\r\n“You are alone, I see, my dear,” she said, as they entered the\r\ndrawing-room together, looking round gravely. Rosamond felt sure that\r\nher aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each\r\nother. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so\r\ncharming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing\r\nfor Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were rather fine, rolled\r\nround that ample quilled circuit, while she spoke.\r\n\r\n“I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,\r\nRosamond.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, aunt?” Rosamond’s eyes also were roaming over her aunt’s\r\nlarge embroidered collar.\r\n\r\n“I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my knowing\r\nit—without your father’s telling me.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes\r\nfinally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and said—\r\n\r\n“I am not engaged, aunt.”\r\n\r\n“How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s talk?”\r\n\r\n“The town’s talk is of very little consequence, I think,” said\r\nRosamond, inwardly gratified.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don’t despise your neighbors so.\r\nRemember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune:\r\nyour father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything. Mr.\r\nLydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction\r\nin that. I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds him\r\nvery useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this\r\nlife is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true\r\nreligious views—there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not\r\nfit to marry a poor man.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He has very high connections.”\r\n\r\n“He told me himself he was poor.”\r\n\r\n“That is because he is used to people who have a high style of living.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style.”\r\n\r\nRosamond looked down and played with her reticule. She was not a fiery\r\nyoung lady and had no sharp answers, but she meant to live as she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n“Then it is really true?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly\r\nat her niece. “You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate—there is some\r\nunderstanding between you, though your father doesn’t know. Be open, my\r\ndear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?”\r\n\r\nPoor Rosamond’s feelings were very unpleasant. She had been quite easy\r\nas to Lydgate’s feeling and intention, but now when her aunt put this\r\nquestion she did not like being unable to say Yes. Her pride was hurt,\r\nbut her habitual control of manner helped her.\r\n\r\n“Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the subject.”\r\n\r\n“You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I\r\ntrust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that\r\nyou have refused!—and one still within your reach, if you will not\r\nthrow it away. I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by\r\ndoing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man—some might think\r\ngood-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is\r\nbetter than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would have\r\nyou seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her heart\r\nwithin her own power.”\r\n\r\n“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already\r\nrefused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without change,”\r\nsaid Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and\r\nplaying the part prettily.\r\n\r\n“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,\r\nrising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be engaged without\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment\r\nto you?”\r\n\r\nRosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she felt\r\nmuch mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all\r\nthe more convinced.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what\r\nhis wife bade him, and she now, without telling her reasons, desired\r\nhim on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr.\r\nLydgate whether he had any intention of marrying soon. The result was a\r\ndecided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that\r\nLydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could\r\nissue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty\r\nbefore her, and she soon managed to arrange a _tête-à-tête_ with\r\nLydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health,\r\nand expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family,\r\nto general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with\r\nregard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and\r\ndisappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a\r\ngirl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much\r\ncompany,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “Gentlemen pay her attention, and\r\nengross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and\r\nthat drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr.\r\nLydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs.\r\nBulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of\r\nwarning, if not of rebuke.\r\n\r\n“Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little\r\nin return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go\r\nabout with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest\r\nshe should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she\r\nmust.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know that\r\nour young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it\r\nmay militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable settlement\r\nin life, and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch\r\nOrlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s\r\nmeaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was\r\nnecessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate” she had\r\nthrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still\r\nevident enough.\r\n\r\nLydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt\r\ncuriously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to\r\nbeckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his\r\nhollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he\r\nhad been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.\r\nBulstrode, having no doubt that she had been understood, turned the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nSolomon’s Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore\r\npalate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes. The\r\nnext day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street, supposed\r\nthat they should meet at Vincy’s in the evening. Lydgate answered\r\ncurtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening.\r\n\r\n“What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping\r\nyour ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be won by the\r\nsirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”\r\n\r\nA few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as\r\nanything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting things. They seemed\r\nnow to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had\r\nbeen making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood:\r\nnot, he believed, by Rosamond herself; she, he felt sure, took\r\neverything as lightly as he intended it. She had an exquisite tact and\r\ninsight in relation to all points of manners; but the people she lived\r\namong were blunderers and busybodies. However, the mistake should go no\r\nfarther. He resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to\r\nMr. Vincy’s except on business.\r\n\r\nRosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her\r\naunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had\r\nnot seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly\r\ncome—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes\r\nout the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness for\r\nher, as a wilderness that a magician’s spells had turned for a little\r\nwhile into a garden. She felt that she was beginning to know the pang\r\nof disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of\r\nsuch delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last\r\nsix months. Poor Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as\r\nAriadne—as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full\r\nof costumes and no hope of a coach.\r\n\r\nThere are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike\r\ncalled love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an\r\napology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily Rosamond\r\ndid not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited her fair\r\nhair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her most\r\ncheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some\r\nway to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a\r\nspontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines ten days too\r\nshort a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other\r\nmeasurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual circuit of\r\nalarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in\r\nthe elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was\r\nrequested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked\r\nchange in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished him to come to\r\nStone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the\r\nwarehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket-book\r\nand left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not\r\noccur to him, from which we may conclude that he had no strong\r\nobjection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at\r\nhome, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various\r\nmotives, decline to give his company, but perhaps not even a sage would\r\nbe gratified that nobody missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way\r\nof piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words\r\nwith Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve\r\nto take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,\r\nthat momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.\r\nBulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs\r\ninto the more substantial web of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nMiss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that\r\nhe felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,\r\nhe began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,\r\nalmost formally, to deliver the message to her father. Rosamond, who at\r\nthe first moment felt as if her happiness were returning, was keenly\r\nhurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had departed, and she assented\r\ncoldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work\r\nwhich she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at Lydgate\r\nhigher than his chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the\r\nhalf of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he moved his\r\nwhip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made\r\nnervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to\r\nbetray it, dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too,\r\nmechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.\r\nWhen he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair\r\nlong neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most\r\nperfect management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes\r\nnow he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,\r\nand made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment\r\nshe was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old:\r\nshe felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do\r\nanything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let\r\nthem fall over her cheeks, even as they would.\r\n\r\nThat moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it\r\nshook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was\r\nlooking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted\r\nand rash. He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled\r\nthrough the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in\r\nraising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed\r\nsepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His words were\r\nquite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent,\r\nappealing avowal.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”\r\n\r\nRosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure\r\nthat she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate and the\r\ntears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more complete\r\nanswer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,\r\ncompletely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief\r\nthat this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually\r\nput his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used\r\nto being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two\r\nlarge tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding,\r\nbut it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward\r\na little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and\r\nspeak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession,\r\nand he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive\r\nlavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose\r\nsoul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound himself.\r\n\r\nHe came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just\r\nreturned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be long\r\nbefore he heard of Mr. Featherstone’s demise. The felicitous word\r\n“demise,” which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his spirits\r\neven above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a power,\r\nand communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as a\r\ndemise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that\r\nMr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even\r\nan intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both\r\nsolemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or\r\nsang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to\r\ntake a jovial view of all things that evening: he even observed to\r\nLydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would\r\nsoon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of\r\nRosamond’s engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing\r\nfacility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of\r\nmatrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the\r\nwhole the appropriateness of a little more punch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nThey’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\r\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Tempest_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone’s\r\ninsistent demand that Fred and his mother should not leave him, was a\r\nfeeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the\r\nold man’s blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of\r\nthe family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become\r\nbedridden. Naturally: for when “poor Peter” had occupied his arm-chair\r\nin the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook\r\nprepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which\r\nthey had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone\r\nblood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from\r\npoverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family\r\ncandor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were\r\nalways received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the\r\nsolemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of\r\nwealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to\r\nbanish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should\r\nhave kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no\r\nshadow of such claims. They knew Peter’s maxim, that money was a good\r\negg, and should be laid in a warm nest.\r\n\r\nBut Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all the needy exiles, held a\r\ndifferent point of view. Probabilities are as various as the faces to\r\nbe seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there,\r\nfrom Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To\r\nthe poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done\r\nnothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah\r\nargued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha\r\nsaid that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his\r\nmoney to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be thought but\r\nthat an own brother “lying there” with dropsy in his legs must come to\r\nfeel that blood was thicker than water, and if he didn’t alter his\r\nwill, he might have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations\r\nshould be on the premises and on the watch against those who were\r\nhardly relations at all. Such things had been known as forged wills and\r\ndisputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of\r\nsomehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who\r\nwere no blood-relations might be caught making away with things—and\r\npoor Peter “lying there” helpless! Somebody should be on the watch. But\r\nin this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane; also, some\r\nnephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater subtilty as to\r\nwhat might be done by a man able to “will away” his property and give\r\nhimself large treats of oddity, felt in a handsome sort of way that\r\nthere was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone\r\nCourt as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit.\r\nSister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in\r\nthe Chalky Flats, could not undertake the journey; but her son, as\r\nbeing poor Peter’s own nephew, could represent her advantageously, and\r\nwatch lest his uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable\r\nthings which seemed likely to happen. In fact there was a general sense\r\nrunning in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody\r\nelse, and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the\r\nAlmighty was watching him.\r\n\r\nThus Stone Court continually saw one or other blood-relation alighting\r\nor departing, and Mary Garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their\r\nmessages to Mr. Featherstone, who would see none of them, and sent her\r\ndown with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so. As manager\r\nof the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion\r\nto stay and eat; but she chose to consult Mrs. Vincy on the point of\r\nextra down-stairs consumption now that Mr. Featherstone was laid up.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, you must do things handsomely where there’s last illness\r\nand a property. God knows, I don’t grudge them every ham in the\r\nhouse—only, save the best for the funeral. Have some stuffed veal\r\nalways, and a fine cheese in cut. You must expect to keep open house in\r\nthese last illnesses,” said liberal Mrs. Vincy, once more of cheerful\r\nnote and bright plumage.\r\n\r\nBut some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome\r\ntreating to veal and ham. Brother Jonah, for example (there are such\r\nunpleasant people in most families; perhaps even in the highest\r\naristocracy there are Brobdingnag specimens, gigantically in debt and\r\nbloated at greater expense)—Brother Jonah, I say, having come down in\r\nthe world, was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough\r\nnot to boast of, though it was much better than swindling either on\r\nexchange or turf, but which did not require his presence at Brassing so\r\nlong as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food. He chose\r\nthe kitchen-corner, partly because he liked it best, and partly because\r\nhe did not want to sit with Solomon, concerning whom he had a strong\r\nbrotherly opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his best suit,\r\nconstantly within sight of good cheer, he had a comfortable\r\nconsciousness of being on the premises, mingled with fleeting\r\nsuggestions of Sunday and the bar at the Green Man; and he informed\r\nMary Garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother Peter\r\nwhile that poor fellow was above ground. The troublesome ones in a\r\nfamily are usually either the wits or the idiots. Jonah was the wit\r\namong the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they\r\ncame about the hearth, but seemed to consider Miss Garth a suspicious\r\ncharacter, and followed her with cold eyes.\r\n\r\nMary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease, but\r\nunfortunately there was young Cranch, who, having come all the way from\r\nthe Chalky Flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle Jonah,\r\nalso felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give\r\nhis uncle company. Young Cranch was not exactly the balancing point\r\nbetween the wit and the idiot,—verging slightly towards the latter\r\ntype, and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his\r\nsentiments except that they were not of a forcible character. When Mary\r\nGarth entered the kitchen and Mr. Jonah Featherstone began to follow\r\nher with his cold detective eyes, young Cranch turning his head in the\r\nsame direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was\r\nsquinting, as if he did it with design, like the gypsies when Borrow\r\nread the New Testament to them. This was rather too much for poor Mary;\r\nsometimes it made her bilious, sometimes it upset her gravity. One day\r\nthat she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen\r\nscene to Fred, who would not be hindered from immediately going to see\r\nit, affecting simply to pass through. But no sooner did he face the\r\nfour eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened\r\nto lead to the dairy, and there under the high roof and among the pans\r\nhe gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible\r\nin the kitchen. He fled by another doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not\r\nbefore seen Fred’s white complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of\r\nface, prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were\r\nwittily combined with the lowest moral attributes.\r\n\r\n“Why, Tom, _you_ don’t wear such gentlemanly trousers—you haven’t got\r\nhalf such fine long legs,” said Jonah to his nephew, winking at the\r\nsame time, to imply that there was something more in these statements\r\nthan their undeniableness. Tom looked at his legs, but left it\r\nuncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious\r\nlength of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.\r\n\r\nIn the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes\r\non the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.” Many came,\r\nlunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been\r\nJane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was Mrs. Waule found\r\nit good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable\r\noccupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth (who was so\r\ndeep that she could be found out in nothing) and giving occasional dry\r\nwrinkly indications of crying—as if capable of torrents in a wetter\r\nseason—at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.\r\nFeatherstone’s room. For the old man’s dislike of his own family seemed\r\nto get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting\r\nthings to them. Too languid to sting, he had the more venom refluent in\r\nhis blood.\r\n\r\nNot fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had\r\npresented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in\r\nblack—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her\r\nhand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.\r\nVincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually\r\nadministering a cordial to their own brother, and the\r\nlight-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be expected in\r\na gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large chair.\r\n\r\nOld Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures\r\nappearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more\r\nsuccessfully than the cordial. He was propped up on a bed-rest, and\r\nalways had his gold-headed stick lying by him. He seized it now and\r\nswept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could,\r\napparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of\r\nscreech—\r\n\r\n“Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand before\r\nher repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy, with\r\nsmall furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but thought\r\nhimself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed not likely to be\r\ndeceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be\r\nmore greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the\r\ninvisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland\r\nparenthesis here and there—coming from a man of property, who might\r\nhave been as impious as others.\r\n\r\n“Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,\r\n“It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts\r\nand the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my mind—”\r\n\r\n“Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying down his\r\nstick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he\r\nreversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of\r\ncloser fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald head.\r\n\r\n“There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to\r\nme,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit up with you\r\nto-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time\r\nto speak, or let me speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter.\r\n\r\n“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.\r\nWaule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie speechless you may\r\nbe tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and my\r\nchildren”—but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she\r\nwas attributing to her speechless brother; the mention of ourselves\r\nbeing naturally affecting.\r\n\r\n“No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I shan’t\r\nthink of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve made my will.”\r\nHere he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some more of\r\nhis cordial.\r\n\r\n“Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to\r\nothers,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me are not\r\nfine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart\r\npeople push themselves before us.”\r\n\r\nFred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.\r\nFeatherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that\r\nyou may be alone with your friends?”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, I tell you,” said old Featherstone, snappishly. “Stop where\r\nyou are. Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his stick again,\r\nbut failing now that he had reversed the handle. “Good-by, Mrs. Waule.\r\nDon’t you come again.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon. “I\r\nshall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will\r\nallow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in\r\ncontinuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But I\r\npity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother\r\nPeter.”\r\n\r\n“Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the\r\nfirst, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of\r\nFeatherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one\r\nwhich might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I bid you\r\ngood-by for the present.”\r\n\r\nTheir exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his\r\nwig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening grimace, as\r\nif he were determined to be deaf and blind.\r\n\r\nNone the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post\r\nof duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which\r\nthe observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing\r\nthem might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in\r\nsome doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind\r\nitself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and\r\nJane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen\r\non the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah.\r\n\r\nBut their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the\r\npresence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter Featherstone\r\nwas up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local\r\nenlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch\r\nneighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with\r\ntheir interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even\r\nmoved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the\r\nfact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by\r\ncodicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly\r\ngentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for\r\nsomething better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ when\r\nthe bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and all\r\neyes were turned on her as a possible legatee, or one who might get\r\naccess to iron chests.\r\n\r\nBut the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,\r\nwere disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a girl who\r\nshowed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying\r\nmight turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she had her share\r\nof compliments and polite attentions.\r\n\r\nEspecially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor and\r\nauctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land and\r\ncattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely\r\ndistributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for those who\r\ndid not know of him. He was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and\r\nhad been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative,\r\nbeing useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his\r\nfuneral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been named as a\r\nBearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing\r\nmore than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in\r\ncase of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter\r\nFeatherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved\r\nlike as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything\r\nhandsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and\r\nfawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now\r\nextended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at\r\nfifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.\r\nHis admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was\r\naccustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating\r\nthings at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never\r\nused poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was\r\nfortunate, as he was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or\r\nwalking about frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a\r\nman who is very much of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with\r\nhis fore-finger, and marking each new series in these movements by a\r\nbusy play with his large seals. There was occasionally a little\r\nfierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false\r\nopinion, of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man\r\nof some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He\r\nfelt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited\r\nunderstanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,\r\ntook everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with\r\nMr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had\r\nimpressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the\r\nChalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being\r\nan auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, he would\r\nhave smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came\r\npretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an\r\nhonorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the\r\ncelebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail\r\nto recognize his importance.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale,\r\nMiss Garth, if you will allow me,” he said, coming into the parlor at\r\nhalf-past eleven, after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing\r\nold Featherstone, and standing with his back to the fire between Mrs.\r\nWaule and Solomon.\r\n\r\n“It’s not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the bell.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Mary, “I have an errand.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Trumbull, you’re highly favored,” said Mrs. Waule.\r\n\r\n“What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with his seals\r\ndispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me considerably.” Here\r\nhe pressed his lips together, and frowned meditatively.\r\n\r\n“Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said Solomon,\r\nin a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious\r\ncunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and\r\ngood-humored though cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any one\r\nmay give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued, his\r\nsonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by good\r\nspeakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a\r\nfigure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.” The eloquent\r\nauctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said\r\nSolomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s the undeserving I’m\r\nagainst.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,\r\nsignificantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have been\r\nlegatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary\r\ndispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left\r\nhis land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an\r\nunhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect.\r\n\r\n“A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave\r\nit to some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question having\r\ndrawn no answer.\r\n\r\n“What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you\r\nnever can mean to say that. It would be flying in the face of the\r\nAlmighty that’s prospered him.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from\r\nthe fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round\r\nthe inside of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his\r\nhair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay\r\nthere and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were\r\noffering it for sale:\r\n\r\n“‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the\r\nMist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began\r\nsonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since\r\nthe series of events which are related in the following chapters took\r\nplace on the Continent.” He pronounced the last truly admirable word\r\nwith the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,\r\nbut feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which\r\nhis reading had given to the whole.\r\n\r\nAnd now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for\r\nanswering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and\r\nSolomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high\r\nlearning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\r\nreally knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly\r\nhave been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested\r\nfor misprision of treason.\r\n\r\n“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,\r\nreassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I\r\ncan. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels\r\nwith alarming haste, “against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my\r\nopinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a\r\ntolerable judge.”\r\n\r\n“Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule. “But my\r\npoor brother would always have sugar.”\r\n\r\n“If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but, God\r\nbless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I\r\nknow. There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s\r\nvoice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham\r\nset on his table.”\r\n\r\nHe pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his\r\nchair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner\r\nside of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all\r\nthose less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the\r\npredominant races of the north.\r\n\r\n“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed,\r\nwhen Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir\r\nWalter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing,\r\na very superior publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any\r\nwriter to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be\r\nspeedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the\r\ncommencement of ‘Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences well.” (Things never\r\nbegan with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced, both in\r\nprivate life and on his handbills.) “You are a reader, I see. Do you\r\nsubscribe to our Middlemarch library?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary. “Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.”\r\n\r\n“I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no less\r\nthan two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well\r\nselected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,\r\nand others. I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention,\r\nMiss Garth.”\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I have\r\nlittle time for reading.”\r\n\r\n“I should say my brother has done something for _her_ in his will,”\r\nsaid Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had shut the door\r\nbehind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.\r\n\r\n“His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs. Waule.\r\n“She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and\r\nvery proud. And my brother has always paid her wage.”\r\n\r\n“A sensible girl though, in my opinion,” said Mr. Trumbull, finishing\r\nhis ale and starting up with an emphatic adjustment of his waistcoat.\r\n“I have observed her when she has been mixing medicine in drops. She\r\nminds what she is doing, sir. That is a great point in a woman, and a\r\ngreat point for our friend up-stairs, poor dear old soul. A man whose\r\nlife is of any value should think of his wife as a nurse: that is what\r\nI should do, if I married; and I believe I have lived single long\r\nenough not to make a mistake in that line. Some men must marry to\r\nelevate themselves a little, but when I am in need of that, I hope some\r\none will tell me so—I hope some individual will apprise me of the fact.\r\nI wish you good morning, Mrs. Waule. Good morning, Mr. Solomon. I trust\r\nwe shall meet under less melancholy auspices.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Trumbull had departed with a fine bow, Solomon, leaning\r\nforward, observed to his sister, “You may depend, Jane, my brother has\r\nleft that girl a lumping sum.”\r\n\r\n“Anybody would think so, from the way Mr. Trumbull talks,” said Jane.\r\nThen, after a pause, “He talks as if my daughters wasn’t to be trusted\r\nto give drops.”\r\n\r\n“Auctioneers talk wild,” said Solomon. “Not but what Trumbull has made\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n“Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;\r\nAnd let us all to meditation.”\r\n—2 _Henry VI_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night after twelve o’clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr.\r\nFeatherstone’s room, and sat there alone through the small hours. She\r\noften chose this task, in which she found some pleasure,\r\nnotwithstanding the old man’s testiness whenever he demanded her\r\nattentions. There were intervals in which she could sit perfectly\r\nstill, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red fire\r\nwith its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence calmly\r\nindependent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining\r\nafter worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving her contempt.\r\nMary was fond of her own thoughts, and could amuse herself well sitting\r\nin twilight with her hands in her lap; for, having early had strong\r\nreason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for her\r\npeculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance\r\nat that fact. And she had already come to take life very much as a\r\ncomedy in which she had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act\r\nthe mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had\r\nnot had parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude\r\nwithin her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no\r\nunreasonable claims.\r\n\r\nShe sat to-night revolving, as she was wont, the scenes of the day, her\r\nlips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which her fancy\r\nadded fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with their illusions,\r\ncarrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque\r\nwhile everybody else’s were transparent, making themselves exceptions\r\nto everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they\r\nalone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which\r\nwere not quite comic to her. She was secretly convinced, though she had\r\nno other grounds than her close observation of old Featherstone’s\r\nnature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him,\r\nthey were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he\r\nkept at a distance. She had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy’s\r\nevident alarm lest she and Fred should be alone together, but it did\r\nnot hinder her from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would\r\nbe affected, if it should turn out that his uncle had left him as poor\r\nas ever. She could make a butt of Fred when he was present, but she did\r\nnot enjoy his follies when he was absent.\r\n\r\nYet she liked her thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by\r\npassion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its\r\nown powers with interest. Mary had plenty of merriment within.\r\n\r\nHer thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man\r\non the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an\r\naged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of\r\nvices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.\r\nFeatherstone: he was not proud of her, and she was only useful to him.\r\nTo be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at you must be left\r\nto the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them. She had never\r\nreturned him a harsh word, and had waited on him faithfully: that was\r\nher utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about\r\nhis soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.\r\n\r\nTo-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he lay\r\nremarkably still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his bunch of\r\nkeys against the tin box which he always kept in the bed beside him.\r\nAbout three o’clock he said, with remarkable distinctness, “Missy, come\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\nMary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box from under\r\nthe clothes, though he usually asked to have this done for him; and he\r\nhad selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it\r\nanother key, looked straight at her with eyes that seemed to have\r\nrecovered all their sharpness and said, “How many of ’em are in the\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to the old\r\nman’s way of speech. He nodded slightly and she went on.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest—they come every day, I’ll\r\nwarrant—Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come peeping, and\r\ncounting and casting up?”\r\n\r\n“Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every\r\nday, and the others come often.”\r\n\r\nThe old man listened with a grimace while she spoke, and then said,\r\nrelaxing his face, “The more fools they. You hearken, missy. It’s three\r\no’clock in the morning, and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I\r\nhad in my life. I know all my property, and where the money’s put out,\r\nand everything. And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and\r\ndo as I like at the last. Do you hear, missy? I’ve got my faculties.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.\r\n\r\nHe now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve made two\r\nwills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the\r\nkey of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of\r\nthe brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put\r\nthe key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and take out\r\nthe topmost paper—Last Will and Testament—big printed.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Mary, in a firm voice, “I cannot do that.”\r\n\r\n“Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice\r\nbeginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.\r\n\r\n“I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do\r\nanything that might lay me open to suspicion.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I\r\nmade two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I will not,” said Mary, more resolutely still. Her repulsion\r\nwas getting stronger.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, there’s no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life soil\r\nthe beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or your will.”\r\nShe moved to a little distance from the bedside.\r\n\r\nThe old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the\r\none key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he began to work\r\nwith his bony left hand at emptying the tin box before him.\r\n\r\n“Missy,” he began to say, hurriedly, “look here! take the money—the\r\nnotes and gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do as I tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as\r\npossible, and Mary again retreated.\r\n\r\n“I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me to do\r\nit again. If you do, I must go and call your brother.”\r\n\r\nHe let his hand fall, and for the first time in her life Mary saw old\r\nPeter Featherstone begin to cry childishly. She said, in as gentle a\r\ntone as she could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;” and then went\r\naway to her seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince him\r\nthat it was useless to say more. Presently he rallied and said eagerly—\r\n\r\n“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”\r\n\r\nMary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through\r\nher mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She had\r\nto make a difficult decision in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“I will call him, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody else, I say. The young chap. I shall do as I like.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring. Or let me\r\ncall Simmons now, to go and fetch the lawyer? He can be here in less\r\nthan two hours.”\r\n\r\n“Lawyer? What do I want with the lawyer? Nobody shall know—I say,\r\nnobody shall know. I shall do as I like.”\r\n\r\n“Let me call some one else, sir,” said Mary, persuasively. She did not\r\nlike her position—alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange\r\nflaring of nervous energy which enabled him to speak again and again\r\nwithout falling into his usual cough; yet she desired not to push\r\nunnecessarily the contradiction which agitated him. “Let me, pray, call\r\nsome one else.”\r\n\r\n“You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You’ll\r\nnever have the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two hundred—there’s more\r\nin the box, and nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do as I\r\ntell you.”\r\n\r\nMary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man,\r\npropped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out\r\nthe key, and the money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot\r\nthat vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way\r\nin which he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with\r\nharder resolution than ever.\r\n\r\n“It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will not\r\ntouch your money. I will do anything else I can to comfort you; but I\r\nwill not touch your keys or your money.”\r\n\r\n“Anything else—anything else!” said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage,\r\nwhich, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just\r\naudible. “I want nothing else. You come here—you come here.”\r\n\r\nMary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw him\r\ndropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her\r\nlike an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting distorted with the\r\neffort of his hand. She paused at a safe distance.\r\n\r\n“Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compose\r\nyourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you\r\ncan do as you like.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and threw\r\nit with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over\r\nthe foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her chair by the\r\nfire. By-and-by she would go to him with the cordial. Fatigue would\r\nmake him passive. It was getting towards the chillest moment of the\r\nmorning, the fire had got low, and she could see through the chink\r\nbetween the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.\r\nHaving put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over her, she sat\r\ndown, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she went\r\nnear him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after\r\nthrowing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and\r\nlaying his right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and\r\nshe thought that he was dropping off to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what\r\nshe had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning\r\nthose acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all\r\nquestion in the critical moment.\r\n\r\nPresently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every\r\ncrevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head\r\nturned a little on one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps,\r\nand thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next\r\nmoment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all objects\r\nmade her uncertain. The violent beating of her heart rendered her\r\nperceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for\r\nhis breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went to the\r\nwindow and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the\r\nstill light of the sky fell on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe next moment she ran to the bell and rang it energetically. In a\r\nvery little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter Featherstone\r\nwas dead, with his right hand clasping the keys, and his left hand\r\nlying on the heap of notes and gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\nTHREE LOVE PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n“1_st Gent_. Such men as this are feathers, chips, and straws,\r\n    Carry no weight, no force.\r\n\r\n2_d Gent_. But levity\r\n    Is causal too, and makes the sum of weight.\r\n    For power finds its place in lack of power;\r\n    Advance is cession, and the driven ship\r\n    May run aground because the helmsman’s thought\r\n    Lacked force to balance opposites.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried. In the\r\nprosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny,\r\nand on this particular morning a chill wind was blowing the blossoms\r\nfrom the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick\r\nchurchyard. Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to\r\nlight up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand\r\nwithin its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects were remarkably\r\nvarious, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see the\r\nfuneral. The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old\r\ngentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to\r\nhave a funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old\r\nFeatherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been\r\ndevoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who\r\nwould drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand. He loved money,\r\nbut he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and\r\nperhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his\r\npower more or less uncomfortably. If any one will here contend that\r\nthere must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone, I will not\r\npresume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest\r\nnature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early\r\nlife by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that\r\nit is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old\r\ngentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments\r\nbased on his personal acquaintance. In any case, he had been bent on\r\nhaving a handsome funeral, and on having persons “bid” to it who would\r\nrather have stayed at home. He had even desired that female relatives\r\nshould follow him to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a\r\ndifficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She and Jane\r\nwould have been altogether cheered (in a tearful manner) by this sign\r\nthat a brother who disliked seeing them while he was living had been\r\nprospectively fond of their presence when he should have become a\r\ntestator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to\r\nMrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most\r\npresumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told\r\npretty plainly that she was not a blood-relation, but of that generally\r\nobjectionable class called wife’s kin.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the\r\nbrood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way\r\nin which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of\r\nillusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not\r\nmake clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it\r\nformed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the\r\nvexations he could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he\r\ninevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence,\r\nand so far as he was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of\r\ngratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was imaginative,\r\nafter his fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the\r\nwritten orders of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback,\r\nwith the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had\r\ntrappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality. The black\r\nprocession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the\r\nchurchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in\r\nthe wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the\r\nlightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.\r\nThe clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader—also according\r\nto the request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar\r\nreasons. Having a contempt for curates, whom he always called\r\nunderstrappers, he was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.\r\nMr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined\r\nduty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to\r\nhim as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the\r\nshape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old\r\nman, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit\r\nthrough with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up\r\nabove his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader\r\nhad been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s land took its course through Featherstone’s also, so that\r\nMr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of\r\npreaching. Moreover, he was one of the high gentry living four miles\r\naway from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff\r\nof the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the\r\nsystem of things. There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr.\r\nCadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing\r\nwrongly if you liked.\r\n\r\nThis distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the\r\nreason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old\r\nFeatherstone’s funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not\r\nfond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see\r\ncollections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;\r\nand she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the\r\nRector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be\r\naltogether pleasant.\r\n\r\n“I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,” Celia had said; “but I\r\ndon’t like funerals.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must\r\naccommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married Humphrey\r\nI made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very\r\nmuch. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I\r\ncouldn’t have the end without them.”\r\n\r\n“No, to be sure not,” said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nThe upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the\r\nroom occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but\r\nhe had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of\r\nwarnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.\r\nCadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite\r\nmistake about Cush and Mizraim.\r\n\r\nBut for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the\r\nlibrary, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s\r\nfuneral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,\r\nalways afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive\r\npoints in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven\r\nwith moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our\r\nneighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a\r\nparticular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for\r\nus with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity\r\nwhich lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with\r\nthe deepest secrets of her experience seemed to mirror that sense of\r\nloneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The\r\ncountry gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart\r\non their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect\r\ndiscrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was not\r\nat ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.\r\n\r\n“I shall not look any more,” said Celia, after the train had entered\r\nthe church, placing herself a little behind her husband’s elbow so that\r\nshe could slyly touch his coat with her cheek. “I dare say Dodo likes\r\nit: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.”\r\n\r\n“I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,” said\r\nDorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk\r\non his holiday tour. “It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,\r\nunless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of\r\nlives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged\r\nto Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right to feel obliged to me,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Your rich\r\nLowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare\r\nsay you don’t half see them at church. They are quite different from\r\nyour uncle’s tenants or Sir James’s—monsters—farmers without\r\nlandlords—one can’t tell how to class them.”\r\n\r\n“Most of these followers are not Lowick people,” said Sir James; “I\r\nsuppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.\r\nLovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well\r\nas land.”\r\n\r\n“Think of that now! when so many younger sons can’t dine at their own\r\nexpense,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Ah,” turning round at the sound of\r\nthe opening door, “here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete\r\nbefore, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd\r\nfuneral, of course?”\r\n\r\n“No, I came to look after Casaubon—to see how he goes on, you know. And\r\nto bring a little news—a little news, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nnodding at Dorothea as she came towards him. “I looked into the\r\nlibrary, and I saw Casaubon over his books. I told him it wouldn’t do:\r\nI said, ‘This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.’\r\nAnd he promised me to come up. I didn’t tell him my news: I said, he\r\nmust come up.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, now they are coming out of church,” Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.\r\n“Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I\r\nsuppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young\r\nman must be her son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and\r\nson,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded\r\nand said—\r\n\r\n“Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the\r\nmanufacturing interest. You have seen him at my house, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\r\nprovokingly.\r\n\r\n“A coursing fellow, though,” said Sir James, with a fox-hunter’s\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n“And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom\r\nweavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his family look so fair and\r\nsleek,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Those dark, purple-faced people are an\r\nexcellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look at\r\nHumphrey: one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in\r\nhis white surplice.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a solemn thing, though, a funeral,” said Mr. Brooke, “if you take\r\nit in that light, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But I am not taking it in that light. I can’t wear my solemnity too\r\noften, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none\r\nof these people are sorry.”\r\n\r\n“How piteous!” said Dorothea. “This funeral seems to me the most dismal\r\nthing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning. I cannot bear to think\r\nthat any one should die and leave no love behind.”\r\n\r\nShe was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat\r\nhimself a little in the background. The difference his presence made to\r\nher was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly\r\nobjected to her speech.\r\n\r\n“Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out\r\nfrom behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round\r\nhead with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look. He must be of\r\nanother blood, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see!” said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.\r\nCadwallader and leaning forward over her head. “Oh, what an odd face!”\r\nThen with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she\r\nadded, “Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her sudden paleness\r\nas she looked up immediately at her uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“He came with me, you know; he is my guest—puts up with me at the\r\nGrange,” said Mr. Brooke, in his easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as\r\nif the announcement were just what she might have expected. “And we\r\nhave brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would\r\nbe pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very\r\nlife—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you will\r\nhear young Ladislaw talk about it. He talks uncommonly well—points out\r\nthis, that, and the other—knows art and everything of that\r\nkind—companionable, you know—is up with you in any track—what I’ve been\r\nwanting a long while.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his irritation, but\r\nonly so far as to be silent. He remembered Will’s letter quite as well\r\nas Dorothea did; he had noticed that it was not among the letters which\r\nhad been reserved for him on his recovery, and secretly concluding that\r\nDorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he had shrunk\r\nwith proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He now\r\ninferred that she had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and\r\nshe felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal\r\nof dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have\r\ndesired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”\r\n\r\n“A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly. His\r\ngood-nature often made him quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,\r\nand he had divined from Dorothea’s glance at her husband that there was\r\nsome alarm in her mind.\r\n\r\n“A very nice young fellow—Casaubon has done everything for him,”\r\nexplained Mr. Brooke. “He repays your expense in him, Casaubon,” he\r\nwent on, nodding encouragingly. “I hope he will stay with me a long\r\nwhile and we shall make something of my documents. I have plenty of\r\nideas and facts, you know, and I can see he is just the man to put them\r\ninto shape—remembers what the right quotations are, _omne tulit\r\npunctum_, and that sort of thing—gives subjects a kind of turn. I\r\ninvited him some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said\r\nyou couldn’t have anybody in the house, you know, and she asked me to\r\nwrite.”\r\n\r\nPoor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant\r\nas a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether\r\nunfitting now to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite\r\nWill Ladislaw. She could not in the least make clear to herself the\r\nreasons for her husband’s dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully\r\nimpressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the\r\nunbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to\r\nothers. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those\r\nmixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of\r\nus, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he\r\nwished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the\r\nchanges in her husband’s face before he observed with more of dignified\r\nbending and sing-song than usual—\r\n\r\n“You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you\r\nacknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nThe funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.\r\n\r\n“Now you can see him, Mrs. Cadwallader,” said Celia. “He is just like a\r\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt that hangs in Dorothea’s boudoir—quite\r\nnice-looking.”\r\n\r\n“A very pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. “What is your\r\nnephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, he is not my nephew. He is my cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “he is trying his wings. He is\r\njust the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him an\r\nopportunity. He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,\r\nSwift—that sort of man.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “One who can write speeches.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll fetch him in now, eh, Casaubon?” said Mr. Brooke. “He wouldn’t\r\ncome in till I had announced him, you know. And we’ll go down and look\r\nat the picture. There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of\r\nthinker with his fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or\r\nsomebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.\r\nEverything is symbolical, you know—the higher style of art: I like that\r\nup to a certain point, but not too far—it’s rather straining to keep up\r\nwith, you know. But you are at home in that, Casaubon. And your\r\npainter’s flesh is good—solidity, transparency, everything of that\r\nsort. I went into that a great deal at one time. However, I’ll go and\r\nfetch Ladislaw.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n“Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir\r\nQue de voir d’héritiers une troupe affligée\r\nLe maintien interdit, et la mine allongée,\r\nLire un long testament où pales, étonnés\r\nOn leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez.\r\nPour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde\r\nJe reviendrais, je crois, exprès de l’autre monde.”\r\n—REGNARD: _Le Légataire Universel_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied\r\nspecies made much private remark on each other, and were tempted to\r\nthink that so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were\r\neminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the rations. (I fear the\r\npart played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for\r\nart to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the\r\ngullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.)\r\n\r\nThe same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who formed\r\nPeter Featherstone’s funeral procession; most of them having their\r\nminds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to get the\r\nmost of. The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by\r\nmarriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by\r\npossibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and\r\npathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had created a fellowship\r\nin hostility among all persons of the Featherstone blood, so that in\r\nthe absence of any decided indication that one of themselves was to\r\nhave more than the rest, the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy\r\nshould have the land was necessarily dominant, though it left abundant\r\nfeeling and leisure for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained\r\ntowards Mary Garth. Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was\r\nundeserving, and Jonah to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder\r\nsister, held that Martha’s children ought not to expect so much as the\r\nyoung Waules; and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was\r\nsorry to think that Jane was so “having.” These nearest of kin were\r\nnaturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in\r\ncousins and second cousins, and used their arithmetic in reckoning the\r\nlarge sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were too many\r\nof them. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a second cousin\r\nbesides Mr. Trumbull. This second cousin was a Middlemarch mercer of\r\npolite manners and superfluous aspirates. The two cousins were elderly\r\nmen from Brassing, one of them conscious of claims on the score of\r\ninconvenient expense sustained by him in presents of oysters and other\r\neatables to his rich cousin Peter; the other entirely saturnine,\r\nleaning his hands and chin on a stick, and conscious of claims based on\r\nno narrow performance but on merit generally: both blameless citizens\r\nof Brassing, who wished that Jonah Featherstone did not live there. The\r\nwit of a family is usually best received among strangers.\r\n\r\n“Why, Trumbull himself is pretty sure of five hundred—_that_ you may\r\ndepend,—I shouldn’t wonder if my brother promised him,” said Solomon,\r\nmusing aloud with his sisters, the evening before the funeral.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear!” said poor sister Martha, whose imagination of hundreds\r\nhad been habitually narrowed to the amount of her unpaid rent.\r\n\r\nBut in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were\r\ndisturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among\r\nthem as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs.\r\nCadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty,\r\nwhose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair\r\nsleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge\r\nof the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a batrachian unchangeableness\r\nof expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was he bidden\r\nas a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty,\r\nwhich almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all\r\nhumiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very\r\ncomfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have\r\nbeen making up our world entirely without it. No one had seen this\r\nquestionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and she knew nothing\r\nmore of him than that he had twice been to Stone Court when Mr.\r\nFeatherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him for several\r\nhours. She had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her father,\r\nand perhaps Caleb’s were the only eyes, except the lawyer’s, which\r\nexamined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or\r\nsuspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity,\r\nwas interested in the verification of his own guesses, and the calmness\r\nwith which he half smilingly rubbed his chin and shot intelligent\r\nglances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with\r\nthe alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,\r\nwhose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and\r\ntook his seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will\r\nshould be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs\r\nwith the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two\r\nvacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit\r\nto move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals\r\nand trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so\r\ncompromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s done, Mr.\r\nTrumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while\r\nshe turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull’s ear.\r\n\r\n“My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,” said the\r\nauctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.\r\n\r\n“Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,”\r\nMrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.\r\n\r\n“Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving\r\nback to the side of her sister Martha.\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same\r\nundertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I\r\nonly hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the\r\nadditional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving\r\nthem a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to\r\nsudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.\r\n\r\n“I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children\r\nand have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that\r\nsits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess. And stock always\r\nshort, and land most awkward. But if ever I’ve begged and prayed; it’s\r\nbeen to God above; though where there’s one brother a bachelor and the\r\nother childless after twice marrying—anybody might think!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and\r\nhad taken out his snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it again\r\nunopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment,\r\nwas unsuited to the occasion. “I shouldn’t wonder if Featherstone had\r\nbetter feelings than any of us gave him credit for,” he observed, in\r\nthe ear of his wife. “This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it\r\nlooks well when a man wants to be followed by his friends, and if they\r\nare humble, not to be ashamed of them. I should be all the better\r\npleased if he’d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly\r\nuseful to fellows in a small way.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.\r\n\r\nBut I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing\r\na laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his father’s\r\nsnuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a\r\n“love-child,” and with this thought in his mind, the stranger’s face,\r\nwhich happened to be opposite him, affected him too ludicrously. Mary\r\nGarth, discerning his distress in the twitchings of his mouth, and his\r\nrecourse to a cough, came cleverly to his rescue by asking him to\r\nchange seats with her, so that he got into a shadowy corner. Fred was\r\nfeeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including\r\nRigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less\r\nlucky than he was aware of being himself, he would not for the world\r\nhave behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one’s\r\nattention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to Stone Court\r\nthis morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who would be\r\npleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he\r\nexpected to read was the last of three which he had drawn up for Mr.\r\nFeatherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his manners: he\r\nbehaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as\r\nif he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,\r\nwhich would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning\r\nthe King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of\r\nhim, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain.\r\n\r\nOld Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the fire that\r\nStandish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he had done as\r\nhe liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he\r\nwould not have secured that minor end; still he had had his pleasure in\r\nruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at\r\nall sorry; on the contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little\r\ncuriosity in his own mind, which the discovery of a second will added\r\nto the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.\r\n\r\nAs to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter\r\nsuspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain\r\nvalidity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s\r\nformer and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before\r\nanybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least\r\nthe advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a\r\nthoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but\r\nSolomon took out his white handkerchief again with a sense that in any\r\ncase there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however\r\ndry, was customarily served up in lawn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this\r\nmoment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she who had\r\nvirtually determined the production of this second will, which might\r\nhave momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul\r\nexcept herself knew what had passed on that final night.\r\n\r\n“The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the\r\ntable in the middle of the room, took his time about everything,\r\nincluding the coughs with which he showed a disposition to clear his\r\nvoice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on\r\nthe 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent\r\ninstrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,\r\nhardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I\r\nsee”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his\r\nspectacles—“a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven\r\nto some articulation under this pressure of dates.\r\n\r\n“I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr. Standish,\r\n“since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the document, was\r\nthe intention of deceased.”\r\n\r\nThe preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon\r\nshook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided\r\nmeeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the\r\ntable-cloth or on Mr. Standish’s bald head; excepting Mary Garth’s.\r\nWhen all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was\r\nsafe for her to look at them. And at the sound of the first “give and\r\nbequeath” she could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some\r\nfaint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He\r\nsat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more\r\nimportant problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests\r\nwhich might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred\r\nblushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his snuff-box\r\nin his hand, though he kept it closed.\r\n\r\nThe small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was\r\nanother will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could\r\nnot quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well\r\nby in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter\r\ncapable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his own\r\nbrothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his own nephews and\r\nnieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were\r\neach to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane\r\nand fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were\r\neach to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin\r\nobserved, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was\r\nmuch more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not\r\npresent—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.\r\nAltogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed\r\nof. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go—and where\r\nthe land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and was the\r\nrevocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,\r\nand might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to\r\nbear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their\r\nlower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their\r\nmuscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and\r\nbegan to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of\r\ngetting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware\r\nthat her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely\r\nflooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while\r\nsomebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that\r\nthe “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were\r\nsurprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were\r\ndeclared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his\r\nlips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the\r\nhappiest of women—possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this\r\ndazzling vision.\r\n\r\nThere was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but\r\nthe whole was left to one person, and that person was—O possibilities!\r\nO expectations founded on the favor of “close” old gentlemen! O endless\r\nvocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the\r\nmeasurement of mortal folly!—that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg,\r\nwho was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of\r\nFeatherstone.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the\r\nroom. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced\r\nno surprise.\r\n\r\n“A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,\r\npreferring for once that he should be considered ignorant in the past.\r\n“But there is a second will—there is a further document. We have not\r\nyet heard the final wishes of the deceased.”\r\n\r\nMary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the\r\nfinal wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to\r\nthe low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the\r\noccasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in\r\nLowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua\r\nRigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and\r\nendowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone’s\r\nAlms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch\r\nalready bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing—so the\r\ndocument declared—to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a\r\nfarthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time\r\nfor the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not look\r\nat Fred.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy was the first to speak—after using his snuff-box\r\nenergetically—and he spoke with loud indignation. “The most\r\nunaccountable will I ever heard! I should say he was not in his right\r\nmind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,” added Mr.\r\nVincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.\r\n“Eh Standish?”\r\n\r\n“Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,” said Mr.\r\nStandish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens\r\nof Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very respectable\r\nsolicitor.”\r\n\r\n“I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of intellect in\r\nthe late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull, “but I call this\r\nwill eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and\r\nhe intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show\r\nitself in his will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an\r\nacknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,” said\r\nCaleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the\r\nwill had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward\r\nman. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!” said\r\nthe lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips with\r\nnicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him\r\nthat words were the hardest part of “business.”\r\n\r\nBut here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he always\r\nwas a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out\r\neverything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn\r\nme from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense of\r\ntravelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s the first\r\ntime I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God\r\nAlmighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it’s hard—I can\r\nthink no other.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll do him no good where he’s gone, that’s my belief,” said Solomon,\r\nwith a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his tone could\r\nnot help being sly. “Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won’t cover\r\nit, when he’s had the impudence to show it at the last.”\r\n\r\n“And all the while had got his own lawful family—brothers and sisters\r\nand nephews and nieces—and has sat in church with ’em whenever he\r\nthought well to come,” said Mrs. Waule. “And might have left his\r\nproperty so respectable, to them that’s never been used to extravagance\r\nor unsteadiness in no manner of way—and not so poor but what they could\r\nhave saved every penny and made more of it. And me—the trouble I’ve\r\nbeen at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly—and him with\r\nthings on his mind all the while that might make anybody’s flesh creep.\r\nBut if the Almighty’s allowed it, he means to punish him for it.\r\nBrother Solomon, I shall be going, if you’ll drive me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no desire to put my foot on the premises again,” said Solomon.\r\n“I’ve got land of my own and property of my own to will away.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It never\r\nanswers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog in the\r\nmanger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool’s will is\r\nenough in a family.”\r\n\r\n“There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I shan’t\r\nleave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t leave it to\r\nfoundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,\r\nand not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on ’em.”\r\n\r\nSolomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he\r\nrose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more\r\nstinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was no use in\r\noffending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain\r\nthat he was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men\r\nwhose name he was about to bear.\r\n\r\nMr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little about any\r\ninnuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to\r\nMr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. He had\r\na high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he no longer moved\r\nto laughter, thought him the lowest monster he had ever seen. But Fred\r\nwas feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an\r\nopportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing\r\nhow many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and\r\nprofits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a\r\nsecond cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though\r\ntoo much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till\r\nhe observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and was crying\r\nsilently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose immediately, and\r\nturning his back on the company while he said to her in an\r\nundertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of yourself, my\r\ndear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud voice—“Go and\r\norder the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste.”\r\n\r\nMary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with her\r\nfather. She met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the\r\ncourage to look at him. He had that withered sort of paleness which\r\nwill sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was very cold when she\r\nshook it. Mary too was agitated; she was conscious that fatally,\r\nwithout will of her own, she had perhaps made a great difference to\r\nFred’s lot.\r\n\r\n“Good-by,” she said, with affectionate sadness. “Be brave, Fred. I do\r\nbelieve you are better without the money. What was the good of it to\r\nMr. Featherstone?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all very fine,” said Fred, pettishly. “What is a fellow to do?\r\nI must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex Mary: very\r\nwell; then she must tell him what else he could do.) “And I thought I\r\nshould be able to pay your father at once and make everything right.\r\nAnd you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall you do now,\r\nMary?”\r\n\r\n“Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My father\r\nhas enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nIn a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed\r\nFeatherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger had\r\nbeen brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but in the\r\ncase of Mr. Rigg Featherstone there was more discontent with immediate\r\nvisible consequences than speculation as to the effect which his\r\npresence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic enough to have\r\nany foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of Joshua Rigg.\r\n\r\nAnd here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low\r\nsubject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way. The\r\nchief objection to them is, that the diligent narrator may lack space,\r\nor (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of them with\r\nany degree of particularity, though he may have a philosophical\r\nconfidence that if known they would be illustrative. It seems an easier\r\nand shorter way to dignity, to observe that—since there never was a\r\ntrue story which could not be told in parables, where you might put a\r\nmonkey for a margrave, and vice versa—whatever has been or is to be\r\nnarrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a\r\nparable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought\r\ninto view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more\r\nthan figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company\r\nwith persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies,\r\nmy reader’s imagination need not be entirely excluded from an\r\noccupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high\r\nstanding would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of\r\nhigh commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of\r\nproportional ciphers.\r\n\r\nAs to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral\r\nrank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first Reform Bill,\r\nand Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and buried some months\r\nbefore Lord Grey came into office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n’T is strange to see the humors of these men,\r\nThese great aspiring spirits, that should be wise:\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nFor being the nature of great spirits to love\r\nTo be where they may be most eminent;\r\nThey, rating of themselves so farre above\r\nUs in conceit, with whom they do frequent,\r\nImagine how we wonder and esteeme\r\nAll that they do or say; which makes them strive\r\nTo make our admiration more extreme,\r\nWhich they suppose they cannot, ’less they give\r\nNotice of their extreme and highest thoughts.\r\n—DANIEL: _Tragedy of Philotas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy went home from the reading of the will with his point of view\r\nconsiderably changed in relation to many subjects. He was an\r\nopen-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself:\r\nwhen he was disappointed in a market for his silk braids, he swore at\r\nthe groom; when his brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him, he made\r\ncutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he regarded\r\nFred’s idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his throwing an\r\nembroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to\r\nbed, “I hope you’ve made up your mind now to go up next term and pass\r\nyour examination. I’ve taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no\r\ntime in taking yours.”\r\n\r\nFred made no answer: he was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours\r\nago he had thought that instead of needing to know what he should do,\r\nhe should by this time know that he needed to do nothing: that he\r\nshould hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine\r\nhack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he should\r\nbe able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have\r\nany reason for not marrying him. And all this was to have come without\r\nstudy or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the\r\nshape of an old gentleman’s caprice. But now, at the end of the\r\ntwenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was\r\n“rather hard lines” that while he was smarting under this\r\ndisappointment he should be treated as if he could have helped it. But\r\nhe went away silently and his mother pleaded for him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be hard on the poor boy, Vincy. He’ll turn out well yet, though\r\nthat wicked man has deceived him. I feel as sure as I sit here, Fred\r\nwill turn out well—else why was he brought back from the brink of the\r\ngrave? And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him the land, to\r\npromise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not\r\npromising? And you see he did leave him ten thousand pounds, and then\r\ntook it away again.”\r\n\r\n“Took it away again!” said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. “I tell you the lad’s\r\nan unlucky lad, Lucy. And you’ve always spoiled him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Vincy, he was my first, and you made a fine fuss with him when\r\nhe came. You were as proud as proud,” said Mrs. Vincy, easily\r\nrecovering her cheerful smile.\r\n\r\n“Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say,”\r\nsaid the husband—more mildly, however.\r\n\r\n“But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond\r\nother people’s sons: you may hear it in his speech, that he has kept\r\ncollege company. And Rosamond—where is there a girl like her? She might\r\nstand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for it. You\r\nsee—Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and\r\nhe fell in love with her at once. Not but what I could have wished\r\nRosamond had not engaged herself. She might have met somebody on a\r\nvisit who would have been a far better match; I mean at her\r\nschoolfellow Miss Willoughby’s. There are relations in that family\r\nquite as high as Mr. Lydgate’s.”\r\n\r\n“Damn relations!” said Mr. Vincy; “I’ve had enough of them. I don’t\r\nwant a son-in-law who has got nothing but his relations to recommend\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, “you seemed as pleased as could be\r\nabout it. It’s true, I wasn’t at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn’t\r\na word to say against the engagement. And she has begun to buy in the\r\nbest linen and cambric for her underclothing.”\r\n\r\n“Not by my will,” said Mr. Vincy. “I shall have enough to do this year,\r\nwith an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes. The\r\ntimes are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I don’t\r\nbelieve Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan’t give my consent to their\r\nmarrying. Let ’em wait, as their elders have done before ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Rosamond will take it hard, Vincy, and you know you never could bear\r\nto cross her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I could. The sooner the engagement’s off, the better. I don’t\r\nbelieve he’ll ever make an income, the way he goes on. He makes\r\nenemies; that’s all I hear of his making.”\r\n\r\n“But he stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode, my dear. The marriage\r\nwould please _him_, I should think.”\r\n\r\n“Please the deuce!” said Mr. Vincy. “Bulstrode won’t pay for their\r\nkeep. And if Lydgate thinks I’m going to give money for them to set up\r\nhousekeeping, he’s mistaken, that’s all. I expect I shall have to put\r\ndown my horses soon. You’d better tell Rosy what I say.”\r\n\r\nThis was a not infrequent procedure with Mr. Vincy—to be rash in jovial\r\nassent, and on becoming subsequently conscious that he had been rash,\r\nto employ others in making the offensive retractation. However, Mrs.\r\nVincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next\r\nmorning in letting Rosamond know what he had said. Rosamond, examining\r\nsome muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain\r\nturn of her graceful neck, of which only long experience could teach\r\nyou that it meant perfect obstinacy.\r\n\r\n“What do you say, my dear?” said her mother, with affectionate\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\n“Papa does not mean anything of the kind,” said Rosamond, quite calmly.\r\n“He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved. And I\r\nshall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since papa gave his\r\nconsent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton’s house.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do\r\nmanage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler’s is the\r\nplace—far better than Hopkins’s. Mrs. Bretton’s is very large, though:\r\nI should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal\r\nof furniture—carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And you\r\nhear, your papa says he will give no money. Do you think Mr. Lydgate\r\nexpects it?”\r\n\r\n“You cannot imagine that I should ask him, mamma. Of course he\r\nunderstands his own affairs.”\r\n\r\n“But he may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of\r\nyour having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so\r\ndreadful—there’s no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor\r\nboy disappointed as he is.”\r\n\r\n“That has nothing to do with my marriage, mamma. Fred must leave off\r\nbeing idle. I am going up-stairs to take this work to Miss Morgan: she\r\ndoes the open hemming very well. Mary Garth might do some work for me\r\nnow, I should think. Her sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I\r\nknow about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric frilling\r\ndouble-hemmed. And it takes a long time.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Vincy’s belief that Rosamond could manage her papa was well\r\nfounded. Apart from his dinners and his coursing, Mr. Vincy, blustering\r\nas he was, had as little of his own way as if he had been a prime\r\nminister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for him, as it\r\nis for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called\r\nRosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence\r\nwhich, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its\r\nway in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he had no other\r\nfixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit,\r\nand this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive\r\nline of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to\r\ninquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own\r\ninability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage\r\nor an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and\r\neasy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill\r\nhours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early\r\nfrost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day.\r\nThe indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy\r\nwas prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man\r\ntowards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on\r\nthe floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of\r\nhim, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little\r\nindisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was\r\nnot advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a\r\nman better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little\r\nafraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy\r\npreferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises.\r\nIn the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal\r\ncommunication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner,\r\nwine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours\r\nwere each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming the final\r\nreason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted\r\nlover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not\r\nat all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective\r\nincome from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own\r\neyes. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings\r\nto—the things whence its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely\r\nperceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from\r\nblue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and\r\nlip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs\r\nand indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of\r\ncompleteness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web\r\nfrom his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience\r\nsupposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of\r\nmedicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes\r\npresented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of\r\nscientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic\r\nlove than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.\r\nAs for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at\r\nits own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the\r\nmutual web. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where\r\nthe piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of\r\nrainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The\r\ncertainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general\r\nin Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement.\r\n\r\nAunt Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time she\r\naddressed herself to her brother, going to the warehouse expressly to\r\navoid Mrs. Vincy’s volatility. His replies were not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go\r\non without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate’s prospects?” said Mrs. Bulstrode,\r\nopening her eyes with wider gravity at her brother, who was in his\r\npeevish warehouse humor. “Think of this girl brought up in luxury—in\r\ntoo worldly a way, I am sorry to say—what will she do on a small\r\nincome?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town\r\nwithout any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate?\r\nBulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any\r\nfuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband\r\nabout it, not me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he\r\ndid not wish for the engagement.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have\r\ninvited him.”\r\n\r\n“But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a\r\nmercy,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her clew in the intricacies of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am\r\nworried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,\r\nHarriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always\r\nshow that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been\r\nexpected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no\r\naccomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet\r\nhad to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the\r\nconversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent\r\nsparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bulstrode did not repeat her brother’s complaints to her husband,\r\nbut in the evening she spoke to him of Lydgate and Rosamond. He did not\r\nshare her warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of\r\nthe risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the\r\ndesirability of prudence.\r\n\r\n“I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as\r\nshe has been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n“Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not\r\nof this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the\r\nobstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to\r\nrecognize with regard to your brother’s family. I could have wished\r\nthat Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations\r\nwith him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s purposes which\r\nis taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she\r\nfelt to her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was\r\none of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.\r\n\r\nAs to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept\r\nall the consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect\r\nclearness. Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half\r\na year. This was not what he had intended; but other schemes would not\r\nbe hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of\r\ncourse, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken\r\ninstead of the rooms he at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard\r\nRosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s house (situated in\r\nLowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old lady’s\r\ndeath, and immediately entered into treaty for it.\r\n\r\nHe did this in an episodic way, very much as he gave orders to his\r\ntailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of\r\nbeing extravagant. On the contrary, he would have despised any\r\nostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all\r\ngrades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships.\r\nHe would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served\r\nin a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered nothing\r\nabout a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But\r\nit had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what\r\nhe would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and\r\nexcellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social\r\ntheories he had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even\r\nextreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,\r\nand preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us\r\nindissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s tendency was not\r\ntowards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines,\r\nbeing particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to\r\nanything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the\r\nrest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that\r\npersonal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called\r\ncommonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation\r\nwith favorite ideas.\r\n\r\nAny inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement\r\nwhich had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of\r\nmoney. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some\r\none who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent\r\nher to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which\r\nmight serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great,\r\nimminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the\r\nmarriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the\r\nVicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to\r\nexamine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s\r\ntableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—\r\n\r\n“Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and\r\nnow he brings back chaos.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling,\r\nwhile he began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will\r\nbegin after.”\r\n\r\n“Soon?” said the Vicar.\r\n\r\n“I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,\r\nand when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I\r\nfeel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to\r\nwork steadily. He has everything at home then—no teasing with personal\r\nspeculations—he can get calmness and freedom.”\r\n\r\n“You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a\r\nprospect—Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I\r\nwith nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”\r\n\r\nLydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing\r\nto shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him,\r\neven with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so\r\noften with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into\r\nMiddlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general\r\nfutility. He had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions\r\nwith trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the\r\nbest inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.\r\nVincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as\r\nto the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended\r\nson-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he\r\nwas descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that\r\nexquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at\r\nleast one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a\r\nmuch-needed transplantation.\r\n\r\n“Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat\r\ndown by her and looked closely at her face—\r\n\r\nBut I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room,\r\nwhere the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of\r\nthe room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of\r\nthe house. Her father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest\r\nwere all out with the butterflies.\r\n\r\n“Dear! your eyelids are red.”\r\n\r\n“Are they?” said Rosamond. “I wonder why.” It was not in her nature to\r\npour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on\r\nsolicitation.\r\n\r\n“As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand\r\ntenderly on both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the\r\nlashes? Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. That is unloving.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day\r\nthings:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”\r\n\r\n“Family annoyances. Don’t fear speaking. I guess them.”\r\n\r\n“Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this\r\nmorning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his\r\nwhole education away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”\r\n\r\nRosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush.\r\nLydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their\r\nengagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at\r\nthis moment. He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond\r\ncontinued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should\r\ncertainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”\r\n\r\n“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.\r\n\r\n“I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond,\r\nrecovering her calmness at the touching of this chord.\r\n\r\n“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of\r\npurpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:—\r\n\r\n“It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be\r\ngiven up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is done\r\nto make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”\r\n\r\nAn unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his,\r\nand the radiance seemed to light up all his future with mild sunshine.\r\nIdeal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you\r\nare invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a\r\nparadise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed\r\nto be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting, more or less.\r\n\r\n“Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. “I have\r\ntaken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not?\r\nYou will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling\r\nwith more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.\r\n“This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought\r\nafter marriage.”\r\n\r\n“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for\r\nthe sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was\r\ntormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from\r\nspeedy marriage. “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of\r\nhappiness even than this—being continually together, independent of\r\nothers, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon\r\nyou can be altogether mine.”\r\n\r\nThere was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she\r\nwould be injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious\r\ntoo, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many\r\nintricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order\r\nto give an answer that would at least be approximative.\r\n\r\n“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,\r\nreleasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.\r\n\r\nOne little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her\r\nneck a meditative turn, and then said seriously—\r\n\r\n“There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.\r\nStill, mamma could see to those while we were away.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to be sure. We must be away a week or so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, more than that!” said Rosamond, earnestly. She was thinking of her\r\nevening dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, which she had\r\nlong been secretly hoping for as a delightful employment of at least\r\none quarter of the honeymoon, even if she deferred her introduction to\r\nthe uncle who was a doctor of divinity (also a pleasing though sober\r\nkind of rank, when sustained by blood). She looked at her lover with\r\nsome wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood\r\nthat she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.\r\n\r\n“Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take\r\na decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be\r\nsuffering. Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”\r\n\r\n“I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then,\r\nmention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She\r\nblushed and looked at him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk\r\nforth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there\r\nnot a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate\r\npetals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?\r\n\r\nHe touched her ear and a little bit of neck under it with his lips, and\r\nthey sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small\r\ngurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon it. Rosamond thought\r\nthat no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought\r\nthat after all his wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he had found\r\nperfect womanhood—felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded\r\naffection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who\r\nvenerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never\r\ninterfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts\r\nwith still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and\r\ntransform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the\r\ntrue womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore,\r\nand ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was\r\nplainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a\r\nbachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a\r\nfurtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to\r\nBrassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him as so exactly\r\nthe right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do these\r\nthings just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.\r\nThe dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the\r\nnature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but\r\nthen it had to be done only once.\r\n\r\n“It must be lovely,” said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his\r\npurchase with some descriptive touches. “Just what Rosy ought to have.\r\nI trust in heaven it won’t be broken!”\r\n\r\n“One must hire servants who will not break things,” said Lydgate.\r\n(Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences.\r\nBut at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or\r\nless sanctioned by men of science.)\r\n\r\nOf course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma,\r\nwho did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a\r\nhappy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s\r\nmarriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that\r\npapa should be appealed to in writing. She prepared for the arrival of\r\nthe letter by walking with her papa to the warehouse the next morning,\r\nand telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, my dear!” said Mr. Vincy. “What has he got to marry on?\r\nYou’d much better give up the engagement. I’ve told you so pretty\r\nplainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you\r\nare to go and marry a poor man? It’s a cruel thing for a father to\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate is not poor, papa. He bought Mr. Peacock’s practice,\r\nwhich, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense! What’s buying a practice? He might as well buy\r\nnext year’s swallows. It’ll all slip through his fingers.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, papa, he will increase the practice. See how he has\r\nbeen called in by the Chettams and Casaubons.”\r\n\r\n“I hope he knows I shan’t give anything—with this disappointment about\r\nFred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking\r\neverywhere, and an election coming on—”\r\n\r\n“Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?”\r\n\r\n“A pretty deal to do with it! We may all be ruined for what I know—the\r\ncountry’s in that state! Some say it’s the end of the world, and be\r\nhanged if I don’t think it looks like it! Anyhow, it’s not a time for\r\nme to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to\r\nknow that.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure he expects nothing, papa. And he has such very high\r\nconnections: he is sure to rise in one way or another. He is engaged in\r\nmaking scientific discoveries.”\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy was silent.\r\n\r\n“I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa. Mr. Lydgate is a\r\ngentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.\r\nYou would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did.\r\nAnd you know that I never change my mind.”\r\n\r\nAgain papa was silent.\r\n\r\n“Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. We shall\r\nnever give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to\r\nlong courtships and late marriages.”\r\n\r\nThere was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said,\r\n“Well, well, child, he must write to me first before I can answer\r\nhim,”—and Rosamond was certain that she had gained her point.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy’s answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should\r\ninsure his life—a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully\r\nreassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a\r\nself-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable\r\nabout Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with\r\nmuch spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride\r\n(who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must have a few first-rate\r\npocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen,\r\nRosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery\r\nand Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred\r\npounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,\r\nrestrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was\r\nshown to him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to\r\nbuy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that\r\nMr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since\r\nit would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills\r\nwould be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how\r\nmuch his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment\r\neasy. He was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite\r\nthings must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a\r\npoor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that\r\nscience and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue\r\nenthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in\r\nsuch a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the\r\nchildren in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,\r\nblack-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched\r\nlymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;\r\nand he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nRosamond, however, was on her side much occupied with conjectures,\r\nthough her quick imitative perception warned her against betraying them\r\ntoo crudely.\r\n\r\n“I shall like so much to know your family,” she said one day, when the\r\nwedding journey was being discussed. “We might perhaps take a direction\r\nthat would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of your uncles do\r\nyou like best?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,—my uncle Godwin, I think. He is a good-natured old fellow.”\r\n\r\n“You were constantly at his house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,\r\nwere you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you\r\nwere used to. Does he know you are going to be married?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his\r\nhair up.\r\n\r\n“Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps\r\nask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the\r\ngrounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,\r\nyou see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is\r\nnot fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would\r\nbe a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.”\r\n\r\nLydgate smiled at her tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that\r\nthe proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some\r\ntrouble. And now he came to think of it, he would like to see the old\r\nspots with Rosamond.\r\n\r\n“I will write to him, then. But my cousins are bores.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of\r\na baronet’s family, and she felt much contentment in the prospect of\r\nbeing able to estimate them contemptuously on her own account.\r\n\r\nBut mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying—\r\n\r\n“I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.\r\nI should think he would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be\r\nnothing to a baronet.”\r\n\r\n“Mamma!” said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her so much\r\nthat he remained silent and went to the other end of the room to\r\nexamine a print curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a\r\nlittle filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond\r\nreflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should\r\nbe induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many things in her own\r\nfamily which might shock them. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate\r\nshould by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in\r\nMiddlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man\r\nwho had a titled uncle and could make discoveries. Lydgate, you\r\nperceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of his hopes as to the\r\nhighest uses of his life, and had found it delightful to be listened to\r\nby a creature who would bring him the sweet furtherance of satisfying\r\naffection—beauty—repose—such help as our thoughts get from the summer\r\nsky and the flower-fringed meadows.\r\n\r\nLydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for\r\nthe sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the\r\ninnate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the\r\nstrength of the gander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nThrice happy she that is so well assured\r\nUnto herself and settled so in heart\r\nThat neither will for better be allured\r\nNe fears to worse with any chance to start,\r\nBut like a steddy ship doth strongly part\r\nThe raging waves and keeps her course aright;\r\nNe aught for tempest doth from it depart,\r\nNe aught for fairer weather’s false delight.\r\nSuch self-assurance need not fear the spight\r\nOf grudging foes; ne favour seek of friends;\r\nBut in the stay of her own stedfast might\r\nNeither to one herself nor other bends.\r\n    Most happy she that most assured doth rest,\r\n    But he most happy who such one loves best.\r\n—SPENSER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general election\r\nor the end of the world that was coming on, now that George the Fourth\r\nwas dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and Peel generally\r\ndepreciated and the new King apologetic, was a feeble type of the\r\nuncertainties in provincial opinion at that time. With the glow-worm\r\nlights of country places, how could men see which were their own\r\nthoughts in the confusion of a Tory Ministry passing Liberal measures,\r\nof Tory nobles and electors being anxious to return Liberals rather\r\nthan friends of the recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies\r\nwhich seemed to have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest,\r\nand were made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors?\r\nBuyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous\r\nposition: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given\r\nup the “Pioneer”—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in\r\nthe van of progress—because it had taken Peel’s side about the Papists,\r\nand had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of Jesuitry and\r\nBaal; but they were ill-satisfied with the “Trumpet,” which—since its\r\nblasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of the public mind\r\n(nobody knowing who would support whom)—had become feeble in its\r\nblowing.\r\n\r\nIt was a time, according to a noticeable article in the “Pioneer,” when\r\nthe crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to\r\npublic action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience\r\nacquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well\r\nas tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those\r\nqualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the\r\nleast disposed to share lodgings.\r\n\r\nMr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more widely\r\nthan usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate channel,\r\nwas heard to say in Mr. Hawley’s office that the article in question\r\n“emanated” from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had secretly bought\r\nthe “Pioneer” some months ago.\r\n\r\n“That means mischief, eh?” said Mr. Hawley. “He’s got the freak of\r\nbeing a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray tortoise. So\r\nmuch the worse for him. I’ve had my eye on him for some time. He shall\r\nbe prettily pumped upon. He’s a damned bad landlord. What business has\r\nan old county man to come currying favor with a low set of dark-blue\r\nfreemen? As to his paper, I only hope he may do the writing himself. It\r\nwould be worth our paying for.”\r\n\r\n“I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it, who\r\ncan write the highest style of leading article, quite equal to anything\r\nin the London papers. And he means to take very high ground on Reform.”\r\n\r\n“Let Brooke reform his rent-roll. He’s a cursed old screw, and the\r\nbuildings all over his estate are going to rack. I suppose this young\r\nfellow is some loose fish from London.”\r\n\r\n“His name is Ladislaw. He is said to be of foreign extraction.”\r\n\r\n“I know the sort,” said Mr. Hawley; “some emissary. He’ll begin with\r\nflourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench.\r\nThat’s the style.”\r\n\r\n“You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,” said Mr. Hackbutt,\r\nforeseeing some political disagreement with his family lawyer. “I\r\nmyself should never favor immoderate views—in fact I take my stand with\r\nHuskisson—but I cannot blind myself to the consideration that the\r\nnon-representation of large towns—”\r\n\r\n“Large towns be damned!” said Mr. Hawley, impatient of exposition. “I\r\nknow a little too much about Middlemarch elections. Let ’em quash every\r\npocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every mushroom town in the\r\nkingdom—they’ll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament. I\r\ngo upon facts.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley’s disgust at the notion of the “Pioneer” being edited by an\r\nemissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political—as if a tortoise of\r\ndesultory pursuits should protrude its small head ambitiously and\r\nbecome rampant—was hardly equal to the annoyance felt by some members\r\nof Mr. Brooke’s own family. The result had oozed forth gradually, like\r\nthe discovery that your neighbor has set up an unpleasant kind of\r\nmanufacture which will be permanently under your nostrils without legal\r\nremedy. The “Pioneer” had been secretly bought even before Will\r\nLadislaw’s arrival, the expected opportunity having offered itself in\r\nthe readiness of the proprietor to part with a valuable property which\r\ndid not pay; and in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his\r\ninvitation, those germinal ideas of making his mind tell upon the world\r\nat large which had been present in him from his younger years, but had\r\nhitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under cover.\r\n\r\nThe development was much furthered by a delight in his guest which\r\nproved greater even than he had anticipated. For it seemed that Will\r\nwas not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which\r\nMr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he was strikingly ready\r\nat seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them\r\nin that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to\r\nquotation and general effectiveness of treatment.\r\n\r\n“He seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,” Mr. Brooke took an\r\nopportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. “I don’t\r\nmean as to anything objectionable—laxities or atheism, or anything of\r\nthat kind, you know—Ladislaw’s sentiments in every way I am sure are\r\ngood—indeed, we were talking a great deal together last night. But he\r\nhas the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty, freedom, emancipation—a\r\nfine thing under guidance—under guidance, you know. I think I shall be\r\nable to put him on the right tack; and I am the more pleased because he\r\nis a relation of yours, Casaubon.”\r\n\r\nIf the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of Mr.\r\nBrooke’s speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred to some\r\noccupation at a great distance from Lowick. He had disliked Will while\r\nhe helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still more now that Will\r\nhad declined his help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy\r\njealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the\r\nburrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom we have grave reasons\r\nfor objecting to) is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any\r\none who admires him passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having\r\nthe scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of\r\ninjuring him—rather we meet all his claims on us by active benefits;\r\nand the drawing of cheques for him, being a superiority which he must\r\nrecognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had\r\nbeen deprived of that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance)\r\nin a sudden, capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring\r\nfrom the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something\r\ndeeper, bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now\r\nthat she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an\r\noffensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration to\r\nthe uneasiness which had before been vague.\r\n\r\nWill Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing at the\r\nexpense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying\r\nthe dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well; on his first\r\nentrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the\r\nglance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past\r\nbenefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the\r\nact of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was\r\na question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one’s\r\nself ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against\r\nanother. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A\r\nman was bound to know himself better than that, and if he chose to grow\r\ngray crunching bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a\r\ngirl into his companionship. “It is the most horrible of\r\nvirgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were\r\nDorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail. But\r\nhe would never lose sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up\r\neverything else in life he would watch over her, and she should know\r\nthat she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself\r\nand others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so\r\nstrongly as the presence of Dorothea.\r\n\r\nInvitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had\r\nnever been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of\r\ndoing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much\r\nabsorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several\r\ntimes (not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him elsewhere on every\r\nopportunity as “a young relative of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had\r\nnot seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore\r\nher former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than\r\nherself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her\r\nmarriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared\r\nmost to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s\r\nsuperior instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any\r\nkeenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of\r\npatience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to\r\nhim from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient\r\nsects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much\r\nof that sort in stock already; at other times he would inform her that\r\nshe was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had questioned.\r\n\r\nBut Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said than she\r\nherself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the ardent woman’s\r\nneed to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the\r\nmere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in\r\nthe wall of her prison, giving her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this\r\npleasure began to nullify her original alarm at what her husband might\r\nthink about the introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this\r\nsubject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb.\r\n\r\nBut Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow\r\ncircumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante\r\nand Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of\r\nthings, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and\r\nmore conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was\r\nlimited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that\r\nhe wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when\r\nMr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county\r\ntown, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at\r\nLowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to\r\nsketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to\r\nwalk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.\r\n\r\nBut the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with\r\ntreacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take\r\nshelter in the house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to\r\ngo into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and\r\nseeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t\r\nmention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.\r\nCasaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”\r\n\r\n“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d\r\nbetter tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given\r\nto lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it\r\nmust be dull for Madam.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,”\r\nsaid Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with\r\ndelightful ease.\r\n\r\nIn another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him\r\nwith her sweet unconstrained smile.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I\r\ndon’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner. He was\r\nuncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say anything\r\nparticular to him?”\r\n\r\n“No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have\r\ndisturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he\r\ndislikes interruption at this hour.”\r\n\r\n“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea\r\nuttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy\r\nchild, visited at school.\r\n\r\n“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,\r\nmysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not stay\r\nto ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we did in\r\nRome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. “Sit down.” She\r\nseated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her,\r\nlooking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without\r\na single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under\r\na vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite\r\nher at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and\r\ndelicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip\r\nand chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers\r\nwhich had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her\r\nhusband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at\r\nher thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had\r\nfound receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she\r\nexaggerated a past solace.\r\n\r\n“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she\r\nsaid, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I said to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his\r\nsoul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be\r\nperfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect,\r\nfor we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the\r\ncompleteness of the beloved object.\r\n\r\n“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said\r\nDorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand\r\njust a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out\r\nreferences for him and save his eyes in many ways. But it is very\r\ndifficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way\r\nto great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too\r\ntired.”\r\n\r\n“If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake\r\nthem before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.\r\nBut through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and\r\nseeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true\r\nthat the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out\r\ntheir ideas.”\r\n\r\n“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have\r\nsaid that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working\r\nthem out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and\r\nit always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life\r\nwould be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen\r\nmight be lighter.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of\r\nmaking a revelation. But she had never before said anything to Will\r\nwhich threw so strong a light on her marriage. He did not shrug his\r\nshoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more\r\nirritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses\r\necclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to take care that his speech\r\nshould not betray that thought.\r\n\r\n“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get\r\nover-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look\r\npaler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he\r\ncould easily get a man who would do half his work for him. It would\r\nsave him more effectually, and you need only help him in lighter ways.”\r\n\r\n“How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest\r\nremonstrance. “I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his\r\nwork. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick. The only\r\nthing I desire is to help him more. And he objects to a secretary:\r\nplease not to mention that again.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr.\r\nBrooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a\r\ngreat deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new\r\nconservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand that\r\none’s mind has other wants,” she added, rather impatiently—“besides,\r\nMr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.”\r\n\r\n“My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to hear Mr.\r\nCasaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary. Indeed he\r\nheld out the prospect of that office to me. But I turned out to be—not\r\ngood enough for it.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her husband’s\r\nevident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile, “You were not a\r\nsteady worker enough.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of\r\na spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to\r\ngive another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory,\r\nhe went on, “And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any\r\none to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing. He is\r\ntoo doubtful—too uncertain of himself. I may not be good for much, but\r\nhe dislikes me because I disagree with him.”\r\n\r\nWill was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our\r\ntongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before\r\ngeneral intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too intolerable\r\nthat Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to\r\nDorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect\r\non her.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had\r\nbeen on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no\r\nlonger struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting\r\nherself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily\r\nat her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of\r\nfailure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became\r\ntenderness. Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more\r\nseverity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her\r\nhusband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better\r\nreason for it.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she\r\nsaid, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his\r\ndislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is\r\nadmirable.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an\r\nabominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited\r\nbecause she made what they called a _mesalliance_, though there was\r\nnothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish\r\nrefugee who gave lessons for his bread.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore\r\nthe change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with\r\nher husband! Do you know much about them?”\r\n\r\n“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak\r\nmany languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.\r\nThey both died rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond\r\nwhat my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents. I\r\nremember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains\r\nwith me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a\r\nlittle bit of bread.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen\r\ninterest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of\r\neverything. But tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not have known\r\nabout you then.”\r\n\r\n“No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was\r\nmy last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were\r\nwell taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his\r\nduty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been\r\nshown to his mother’s sister. But now I am telling you what is not new\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nIn his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what\r\nwas rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr.\r\nCasaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much\r\ntoo good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And\r\nwhen gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of\r\nescaping from its bonds.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on\r\nhis own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct\r\nwas depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his\r\nrelations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a\r\nmoment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your\r\nmother. Is she still living?”\r\n\r\n“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that\r\nmy mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her\r\nhusband. She never would tell me anything about her family, except that\r\nshe forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She\r\nwas a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be\r\ngetting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will\r\nended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with\r\nserious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nBut her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your\r\napology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean,\r\nto Mr. Casaubon’s wishes. You must remember that you have not done what\r\nhe thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of\r\ndislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any\r\npainful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has\r\nbecome from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,” she continued,\r\ngetting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious\r\nMr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who are well\r\nand can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who\r\ncarry a weight of trial.”\r\n\r\n“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject\r\nagain.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the\r\nunutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly\r\nconscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity\r\nand loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her pity and\r\nloyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.\r\n“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I\r\nwill never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would\r\ndisapprove.”\r\n\r\n“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I\r\nshall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will\r\nsoon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of\r\nstaying at the Grange.”\r\n\r\n“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I\r\nwished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in\r\nthis neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and\r\nhe wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”\r\n\r\n“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and\r\nnot settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you\r\nwould not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would\r\nrather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to\r\nnobody anywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as\r\nsimply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow\r\nof a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.\r\n\r\n“Then I _will_ stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising\r\nand going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.\r\n\r\nBut the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting\r\ncontinually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt\r\ndifferently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double\r\nembarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her\r\nhusband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.\r\nHis face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—\r\n\r\n“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you\r\nshould be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything\r\nelse than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real\r\nquestion. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that\r\nthe proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility\r\nthat Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr.\r\nBrooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall\r\nstrike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\nHe approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not\r\ndaring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he\r\ndared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct\r\nwould be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light\r\nthrough. And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming\r\ndimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of\r\nmournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her\r\nthought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose\r\nno time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this\r\nmight seem an undue dictation.\r\n\r\nSo they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking\r\nacross the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until\r\nfour o’clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too\r\nearly to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for\r\ndinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous\r\nceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the\r\nserious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an\r\neasy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London\r\npapers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined\r\nthat relief, observing that he had already had too many public details\r\nurged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea\r\nasked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which\r\nnever forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—\r\n\r\n“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.\r\nSpanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy\r\nrecipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on\r\nthe Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become\r\nme to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over\r\nthe elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as\r\na muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have\r\nbeen becoming.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted\r\nto see her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came\r\nI had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.\r\n\r\n“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of\r\nmy uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband\r\nshe felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance\r\nof the world she had a vague impression that the position offered to\r\nWill was out of keeping with his family connections, and certainly Mr.\r\nCasaubon had a claim to be consulted. He did not speak, but merely\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought\r\none of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to\r\nstay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides\r\nhelping him in other ways.”\r\n\r\nDorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first\r\nblinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips\r\nbecame more tense. “What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly,\r\nafter a slight pause.\r\n\r\n“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.\r\nCasaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at\r\nDorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired about,\r\nbut she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did not swerve.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered immediately, “he did not say that he came to ask\r\nyour opinion. But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected\r\nme to tell you of it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon was silent.\r\n\r\n“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man\r\nwith so much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to\r\ndo good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed\r\noccupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of\r\nthat kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no\r\none cares for him elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband.\r\nHowever, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning\r\nand the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched\r\nthe following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always\r\nbefore addressed him as “Will”):—\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and\r\n(according to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been\r\nin some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this\r\nneighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my\r\nown position in such a way as renders it not only natural and\r\nwarrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of\r\nlegitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is\r\nconsidered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that\r\nyour acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly\r\noffensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,\r\nwould not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of\r\nthe relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past\r\nby your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character\r\nof determining antecedents. I will not here make reflections on any\r\nperson’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to yourself that\r\nthere are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder\r\na somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in\r\nthis vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated\r\nat best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any\r\nrate, the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n“EDWARD CASAUBON.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further\r\nembitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to\r\nagitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and\r\ngrandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her\r\nblue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its pallid\r\nquaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the\r\nsummer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue\r\nof elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an\r\ninward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,\r\nthe invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our\r\nspiritual falls. She had been so used to struggle for and to find\r\nresolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light\r\nthat the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale\r\nstag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we\r\nknow.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an\r\naudience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,\r\nbut still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia”\r\nabout whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband.\r\n\r\nAnd now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had\r\ngathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence\r\nof that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she knew,\r\nhelping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl\r\nfrom the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen\r\na man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her elders with questions\r\nabout the facts around her, had wrought herself into some independent\r\nclearness as to the historical, political reasons why eldest sons had\r\nsuperior rights, and why land should be entailed: those reasons,\r\nimpressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,\r\nbut here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a\r\ndaughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of\r\naristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than\r\nretired grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a\r\nlawn and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question\r\nof liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature\r\nwent on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on\r\nour own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.\r\n\r\nIt was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the\r\nLadislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged\r\nof. And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been\r\nmade at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to\r\nher, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be\r\naltered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had\r\njust arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for\r\nplacing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure,\r\naccording to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just\r\nview, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration\r\nof the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and\r\nwould continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She\r\nsuspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and\r\nthis made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding\r\nshould be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and\r\naccepting the first function that offered itself, he should find\r\nhimself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her\r\nhusband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will,\r\nshould be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to\r\nbe done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking\r\nher from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance\r\nabout her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her;\r\nand Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon\r\nhim. “But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character\r\nlies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of half\r\nof our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of\r\nproperty intended for herself, and always regarded by her as excessive.\r\nShe was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to\r\ntread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness\r\nto whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by\r\nthe side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her\r\nboudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon\r\nhad sent his letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her till\r\nshe could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To\r\nhis preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she\r\nhad never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of\r\nagitating him. But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception\r\nof a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with independent\r\nlife, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion,\r\nnot unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but\r\nthere were hours of the night which might be counted on as\r\nopportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her\r\nhusband’s sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a\r\ncandle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from the\r\nbeginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for a few\r\nhours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly\r\nan hour before he said—\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”\r\n\r\n“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.\r\n\r\n“No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if you will\r\nread me a few pages of Lowth.”\r\n\r\n“May I talk to you a little instead?” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had too\r\nmuch, and especially the prospect of too much.”\r\n\r\n“These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it\r\nseems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong\r\nright must be obeyed.”\r\n\r\n“What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?”\r\n\r\n“That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean, with\r\nregard to property; and that makes me unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.”\r\n\r\n“I have been led to think about your aunt Julia, and how she was left\r\nin poverty only because she married a poor man, an act which was not\r\ndisgraceful, since he was not unworthy. It was on that ground, I know,\r\nthat you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his mother.”\r\n\r\nDorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her\r\nonward. None came, and her next words seemed the more forcible to her,\r\nfalling clear upon the dark silence.\r\n\r\n“But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one, even to\r\nthe half of that property which I know that you have destined for me.\r\nAnd I think he ought at once to be provided for on that understanding.\r\nIt is not right that he should be in the dependence of poverty while we\r\nare rich. And if there is any objection to the proposal he mentioned,\r\nthe giving him his true place and his true share would set aside any\r\nmotive for his accepting it.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this subject?” said\r\nMr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no!” said Dorothea, earnestly. “How can you imagine it, since\r\nhe has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you think too\r\nhardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his parents and\r\ngrandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions. You are so\r\ngood, so just—you have done everything you thought to be right. But it\r\nseems to me clear that more than that is right; and I must speak about\r\nit, since I am the person who would get what is called benefit by that\r\n‘more’ not being done.”\r\n\r\nThere was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not quickly\r\nas before, but with a still more biting emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were well\r\nthat it should be the last, on which you have assumed a judgment on\r\nsubjects beyond your scope. Into the question how far conduct,\r\nespecially in the matter of alliances, constitutes a forfeiture of\r\nfamily claims, I do not now enter. Suffice it, that you are not here\r\nqualified to discriminate. What I now wish you to understand is, that I\r\naccept no revision, still less dictation within that range of affairs\r\nwhich I have deliberated upon as distinctly and properly mine. It is\r\nnot for you to interfere between me and Mr. Ladislaw, and still less to\r\nencourage communications from him to you which constitute a criticism\r\non my procedure.”\r\n\r\nPoor Dorothea, shrouded in the darkness, was in a tumult of conflicting\r\nemotions. Alarm at the possible effect on himself of her husband’s\r\nstrongly manifested anger, would have checked any expression of her own\r\nresentment, even if she had been quite free from doubt and compunction\r\nunder the consciousness that there might be some justice in his last\r\ninsinuation. Hearing him breathe quickly after he had spoken, she sat\r\nlistening, frightened, wretched—with a dumb inward cry for help to bear\r\nthis nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by dread.\r\nBut nothing else happened, except that they both remained a long while\r\nsleepless, without speaking again.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from Will\r\nLadislaw:—\r\n\r\n“DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I have given all due consideration to your letter\r\nof yesterday, but I am unable to take precisely your view of our mutual\r\nposition. With the fullest acknowledgment of your generous conduct to\r\nme in the past, I must still maintain that an obligation of this kind\r\ncannot fairly fetter me as you appear to expect that it should. Granted\r\nthat a benefactor’s wishes may constitute a claim; there must always be\r\na reservation as to the quality of those wishes. They may possibly\r\nclash with more imperative considerations. Or a benefactor’s veto might\r\nimpose such a negation on a man’s life that the consequent blank might\r\nbe more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am merely using\r\nstrong illustrations. In the present case I am unable to take your view\r\nof the bearing which my acceptance of occupation—not enriching\r\ncertainly, but not dishonorable—will have on your own position which\r\nseems to me too substantial to be affected in that shadowy manner. And\r\nthough I do not believe that any change in our relations will occur\r\n(certainly none has yet occurred) which can nullify the obligations\r\nimposed on me by the past, pardon me for not seeing that those\r\nobligations should restrain me from using the ordinary freedom of\r\nliving where I choose, and maintaining myself by any lawful occupation\r\nI may choose. Regretting that there exists this difference between us\r\nas to a relation in which the conferring of benefits has been entirely\r\non your side—\r\n\r\n\r\nI remain, yours with persistent obligation,\r\nWILL LADISLAW.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Casaubon felt (and must not we, being impartial, feel with him\r\na little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than\r\nhe. Young Ladislaw, he was sure, meant to defy and annoy him, meant to\r\nwin Dorothea’s confidence and sow her mind with disrespect, and perhaps\r\naversion, towards her husband. Some motive beneath the surface had been\r\nneeded to account for Will’s sudden change of course in rejecting Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s aid and quitting his travels; and this defiant determination\r\nto fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at\r\nvariance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke’s Middlemarch projects,\r\nrevealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to\r\nDorothea. Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any\r\ndoubleness: he had no suspicions of her, but he had (what was little\r\nless uncomfortable) the positive knowledge that her tendency to form\r\nopinions about her husband’s conduct was accompanied with a disposition\r\nto regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said.\r\nHis own proud reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in\r\nthe supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite\r\nWill to his house.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on receiving Will’s letter, Mr. Casaubon had to consider his\r\nduty. He would never have been easy to call his action anything else\r\nthan duty; but in this case, contending motives thrust him back into\r\nnegations.\r\n\r\nShould he apply directly to Mr. Brooke, and demand of that troublesome\r\ngentleman to revoke his proposal? Or should he consult Sir James\r\nChettam, and get him to concur in remonstrance against a step which\r\ntouched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that\r\nfailure was just as probable as success. It was impossible for him to\r\nmention Dorothea’s name in the matter, and without some alarming\r\nurgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not, after meeting all\r\nrepresentations with apparent assent, to wind up by saying, “Never\r\nfear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw will do you credit.\r\nDepend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.” And Mr.\r\nCasaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir\r\nJames Chettam, between whom and himself there had never been any\r\ncordiality, and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any\r\nmention of her.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody’s feeling towards him,\r\nespecially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he was jealous\r\nwould be to admit their (suspected) view of his disadvantages: to let\r\nthem know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would\r\nimply his conversion to their (probably) earlier disapproval. It would\r\nbe as bad as letting Carp, and Brasenose generally, know how backward\r\nhe was in organizing the matter for his “Key to all Mythologies.” All\r\nthrough his life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to\r\nhimself the inward sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most\r\ndelicate of all personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious\r\nreticence told doubly.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he had\r\nforbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he was mentally preparing\r\nother measures of frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n“C’est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions humaines;\r\ntôt ou tard il devient efficace.”—GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke’s\r\nnew courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James\r\naccounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch with the\r\nCadwalladers by saying—\r\n\r\n“I can’t talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.\r\nIndeed, it would not be right.”\r\n\r\n“I know what you mean—the ‘Pioneer’ at the Grange!” darted in Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend’s tongue.\r\n“It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in\r\neverybody’s hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes, like\r\npoor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable.”\r\n\r\n“I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the\r\n‘Trumpet,’” said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as he\r\nwould have done if he had been attacked himself. “There are tremendous\r\nsarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who\r\nreceives his own rents, and makes no returns.”\r\n\r\n“I do wish Brooke would leave that off,” said Sir James, with his\r\nlittle frown of annoyance.\r\n\r\n“Is he really going to be put in nomination, though?” said Mr.\r\nCadwallader. “I saw Farebrother yesterday—he’s Whiggish himself, hoists\r\nBrougham and Useful Knowledge; that’s the worst I know of him;—and he\r\nsays that Brooke is getting up a pretty strong party. Bulstrode, the\r\nbanker, is his foremost man. But he thinks Brooke would come off badly\r\nat a nomination.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James, with earnestness. “I have been inquiring\r\ninto the thing, for I’ve never known anything about Middlemarch\r\npolitics before—the county being my business. What Brooke trusts to, is\r\nthat they are going to turn out Oliver because he is a Peelite. But\r\nHawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be\r\nBagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but\r\ndead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley’s\r\nrather rough: he forgot that he was speaking to me. He said if Brooke\r\nwanted a pelting, he could get it cheaper than by going to the\r\nhustings.”\r\n\r\n“I warned you all of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her hands\r\noutward. “I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a\r\nsplash in the mud. And now he has done it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the Rector.\r\n“That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with\r\npolitics.”\r\n\r\n“He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has come\r\nout on the other side of the mud with an ague.”\r\n\r\n“What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James. “Of course I\r\ncare the more because of the family. But he’s getting on in life now,\r\nand I don’t like to think of his exposing himself. They will be raking\r\nup everything against him.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s no use trying any persuasion,” said the Rector.\r\n“There’s such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in Brooke.\r\nHave you tried him on the subject?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” said Sir James; “I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate.\r\nBut I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke is making a\r\nfactotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as\r\nwell to hear what he had to say; and he is against Brooke’s standing\r\nthis time. I think he’ll turn him round: I think the nomination may be\r\nstaved off.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. “The independent member\r\nhasn’t got his speeches well enough by heart.”\r\n\r\n“But this Ladislaw—there again is a vexatious business,” said Sir\r\nJames. “We have had him two or three times to dine at the Hall (you\r\nhave met him, by the bye) as Brooke’s guest and a relation of\r\nCasaubon’s, thinking he was only on a flying visit. And now I find he’s\r\nin everybody’s mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the ‘Pioneer.’\r\nThere are stories going about him as a quill-driving alien, a foreign\r\nemissary, and what not.”\r\n\r\n“Casaubon won’t like that,” said the Rector.\r\n\r\n“There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw,” returned Sir James. “I\r\nhope he won’t go into extreme opinions and carry Brooke on.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, “with his opera songs and his ready tongue. A sort of\r\nByronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas Aquinas\r\nis not fond of him. I could see that, the day the picture was brought.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to begin on the subject with Casaubon,” said Sir James.\r\n“He has more right to interfere than I. But it’s a disagreeable affair\r\nall round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show\r\nhimself in!—one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at\r\nKeck, who manages the ‘Trumpet.’ I saw him the other day with Hawley.\r\nHis writing is sound enough, I believe, but he’s such a low fellow,\r\nthat I wished he had been on the wrong side.”\r\n\r\n“What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?” said the\r\nRector. “I don’t suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to\r\nbe writing up interests he doesn’t really care about, and for pay that\r\nhardly keeps him in at elbows.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man\r\nwho has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that\r\nkind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting.”\r\n\r\n“It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Why didn’t he use his\r\ninterest to get Ladislaw made an _attache_ or sent to India? That is\r\nhow families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”\r\n\r\n“There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said Sir\r\nJames, anxiously. “But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?”\r\n\r\n“Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too much of\r\nall this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a month or\r\ntwo Brooke and this Master Ladislaw will get tired of each other;\r\nLadislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the ‘Pioneer,’ and everything\r\nwill settle down again as usual.”\r\n\r\n“There is one good chance—that he will not like to feel his money\r\noozing away,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “If I knew the items of election\r\nexpenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with wide words like\r\nExpenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of\r\nleeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t like, is having our\r\nsixpences sucked away from us.”\r\n\r\n“And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said Sir\r\nJames. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun upon\r\nthat already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance\r\nunder one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one’s\r\nland and tenants, especially in these hard times.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the ‘Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some good\r\nmay come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be glad. I\r\nshould hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t know what I\r\nshould do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”\r\n\r\n“I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him to\r\ntake on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth twelve years\r\nago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting\r\nGarth to manage for me—he has made such a capital plan for my\r\nbuildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not\r\nundertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left it entirely to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an independent\r\nfellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when he was doing\r\nsome valuation for me, he told me point-blank that clergymen seldom\r\nunderstood anything about business, and did mischief when they meddled;\r\nbut he said it as quietly and respectfully as if he had been talking to\r\nme about sailors. He would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke\r\nwould let him manage. I wish, by the help of the ‘Trumpet,’ you could\r\nbring that round.”\r\n\r\n“If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some\r\nchance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in\r\ntime, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had wonderfully\r\ngood notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes her up entirely.\r\nCelia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her to dine with us,\r\nsince he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust,\r\nand Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that\r\n_she_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction.\r\n\r\n“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought\r\nhe looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”\r\n\r\n“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,”\r\n“Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has\r\ngot that way of paring and clipping at expenses.”\r\n\r\n“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to\r\nfind himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he\r\ndoes know his own pocket.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said\r\nSir James.\r\n\r\n“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to\r\nkeep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look\r\nout of the window. “But talk of an independent politician and he will\r\nappear.”\r\n\r\n“What! Brooke?” said her husband.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the\r\nleeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual\r\nposition; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would\r\nbehave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a\r\nsimple and comprehensive programme for social well-being.\r\n\r\n“Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and shaking\r\nhands. “I was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it’s\r\npleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of\r\nthings?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte\r\nsaid—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the next\r\ncentury, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than\r\nwe are.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the\r\n‘Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”\r\n\r\n“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily\r\nadjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his\r\nhand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—\r\n\r\n“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from\r\nMiddlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the most\r\nretrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them that\r\nword in the ‘Pioneer.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!\r\nCome, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make\r\nme out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that\r\ncheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance.\r\n\r\n“I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or\r\ntwo. _If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil\r\nsense of the word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a\r\nreformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he is\r\nimmediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot\r\nbear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants\r\nbeing half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his\r\nfarms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does\r\nnot mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very\r\nopen-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any\r\nnumber of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own\r\npockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to\r\nhelp a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather\r\nout at a tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like\r\nan Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a\r\nphilanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of\r\nthe distance._ And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of\r\nlegislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the Rector,\r\nthrowing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back of his\r\nhead, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.\r\n\r\n“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the\r\npaper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but\r\ncoloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red\r\nat rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my\r\nlife. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing—these men\r\nnever understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true\r\nup to a certain point. I recollect they said that in ‘The Edinburgh’\r\nsomewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious\r\nto tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he\r\nhadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern\r\nof gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one’s timber\r\nin that way.”\r\n\r\n“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nappearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your\r\nhobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”\r\n\r\n“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for\r\nParliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful\r\ncandidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand\r\npounds and failed because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter\r\nreflection for a man!”\r\n\r\n“Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East Retford\r\nwas nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know:\r\nHawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of\r\nthing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not\r\ngoing to have it their own way in future—not in future, you know.\r\nMiddlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the freemen are a little\r\nbackward. But we shall educate them—we shall bring them on, you know.\r\nThe best people there are on our side.”\r\n\r\n“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked\r\nSir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”\r\n\r\n“And that if you got pelted,” interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, “half the\r\nrotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens!\r\nThink what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to\r\nremember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him fall into\r\na dust-heap on purpose!”\r\n\r\n“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the\r\nRector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had\r\nto stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their\r\nreckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is\r\nthe hardest missile one can be pelted with.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must\r\nbe prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against\r\ncalumny.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n“But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read\r\nhistory—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of\r\nthing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that\r\nin Horace?—_fiat justitia, ruat_ … something or other.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I\r\nmean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact\r\nas a contradiction.”\r\n\r\n“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s\r\nself,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n\r\nBut it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.\r\n“Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and\r\nleaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all\r\nfor outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is\r\ngood under all circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”\r\n\r\n“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir\r\nJames. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair\r\nvaluation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at\r\nonce by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving\r\nhim _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the\r\npolitical situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking\r\nhis thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke.\r\n\r\n“That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “But I\r\nshould like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his\r\ntenants for arrears as little as I have. I let the old tenants stay on.\r\nI’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own\r\nideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that is\r\nalways charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of\r\nthing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.”\r\n\r\nAfter that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had\r\nomitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly\r\ngood-by.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see\r\nhe is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of\r\nfact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”\r\n\r\n“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the\r\nRector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling\r\nanother. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and we want to\r\nfrighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular and see that his\r\ncharacter as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t think it signifies\r\ntwo straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or Brooke’s speechifying\r\nto the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the parishioners in\r\nTipton being comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader. “You should have proved to him that he loses money by bad\r\nmanagement, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put him\r\na-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all\r\nvery well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n“If, as I have, you also doe,\r\n    Vertue attired in woman see,\r\nAnd dare love that, and say so too,\r\n    And forget the He and She;\r\n\r\nAnd if this love, though placed so,\r\n    From prophane men you hide,\r\nWhich will no faith on this bestow,\r\n    Or, if they doe, deride:\r\n\r\nThen you have done a braver thing\r\n    Than all the Worthies did,\r\nAnd a braver thence will spring,\r\n    Which is, to keep that hid.”\r\n—DR. DONNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam’s mind was not fruitful in devices, but his growing\r\nanxiety to “act on Brooke,” once brought close to his constant belief\r\nin Dorothea’s capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a\r\nlittle plan; namely, to plead Celia’s indisposition as a reason for\r\nfetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall, and to leave her at the\r\nGrange with the carriage on the way, after making her fully aware of\r\nthe situation concerning the management of the estate.\r\n\r\nIn this way it happened that one day near four o’clock, when Mr. Brooke\r\nand Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs.\r\nCasaubon was announced.\r\n\r\nWill, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and,\r\nobliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging “documents” about hanging\r\nsheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding\r\nseveral horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a\r\nlodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his constant\r\nresidence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier\r\nimages a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric\r\nparticularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he started up as from\r\nan electric shock, and felt a tingling at his finger-ends. Any one\r\nobserving him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the\r\nadjustment of his facial muscles, in the vividness of his glance, which\r\nmight have made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed\r\nthe message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is\r\ntranscendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those\r\ntouches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a\r\nman’s passion for one woman differ from his passion for another as joy\r\nin the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top\r\ndiffers from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too,\r\nwas made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near him\r\ncleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him,\r\nand his point of view shifted as easily as his mood. Dorothea’s\r\nentrance was the freshness of morning.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting and\r\nkissing her. “You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose. That’s\r\nright. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman, you know.”\r\n\r\n“There is no fear of that, uncle,” said Dorothea, turning to Will and\r\nshaking hands with open cheerfulness, while she made no other form of\r\ngreeting, but went on answering her uncle. “I am very slow. When I want\r\nto be busy with books, I am often playing truant among my thoughts. I\r\nfind it is not so easy to be learned as to plan cottages.”\r\n\r\nShe seated herself beside her uncle opposite to Will, and was evidently\r\npreoccupied with something that made her almost unmindful of him. He\r\nwas ridiculously disappointed, as if he had imagined that her coming\r\nhad anything to do with him.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But it was\r\ngood to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to run away with us,\r\nyou know; it doesn’t do to be run away with. We must keep the reins. I\r\nhave never let myself be run away with; I always pulled up. That is\r\nwhat I tell Ladislaw. He and I are alike, you know: he likes to go into\r\neverything. We are working at capital punishment. We shall do a great\r\ndeal together, Ladislaw and I.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, “Sir James has\r\nbeen telling me that he is in hope of seeing a great change made soon\r\nin your management of the estate—that you are thinking of having the\r\nfarms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages improved, so that\r\nTipton may look quite another place. Oh, how happy!”—she went on,\r\nclasping her hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous\r\nmanner, which had been subdued since her marriage. “If I were at home\r\nstill, I should take to riding again, that I might go about with you\r\nand see all that! And you are going to engage Mr. Garth, who praised my\r\ncottages, Sir James says.”\r\n\r\n“Chettam is a little hasty, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, coloring\r\nslightly; “a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do anything\r\nof the kind. I never said I should _not_ do it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“He only feels confident that you will do it,” said Dorothea, in a\r\nvoice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a\r\ncredo, “because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for\r\nthe improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made\r\nbetter is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes,\r\nuncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one\r\nsitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!—and those\r\npoor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the\r\nback kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason\r\nwhy I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me\r\nstupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and\r\ncoarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in\r\nthe drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in\r\nwhat is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the\r\nneighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward\r\nand urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils\r\nwhich lie under our own hands.”\r\n\r\nDorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten\r\neverything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked:\r\nan experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her\r\nmarriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For\r\nthe moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of\r\nremoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a\r\nwoman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having\r\nintended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad\r\noversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of good Mr.\r\nBrooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a\r\nstammering condition under the eloquence of his niece. He could not\r\nimmediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of\r\nrising, fixing his eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At\r\nlast he said—\r\n\r\n“There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you\r\nsay—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our pictures\r\nand statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent,\r\nyou know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of\r\nthing, elevates a nation—_emollit mores_—you understand a little Latin\r\nnow. But—eh? what?”\r\n\r\nThese interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to\r\nsay that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a leveret in\r\nhis hand just killed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,” said Mr.\r\nBrooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James wishes\r\nfor,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was gone.\r\n\r\n“I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget what you\r\nhave said. But can you think of something else at this moment? I may\r\nnot have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has\r\noccurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding\r\nthe back of his chair with both hands.\r\n\r\n“Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and\r\ngoing to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and\r\nwagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame, and\r\nlaid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she was not\r\nfond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was\r\nalways attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to\r\ndecline their advances.\r\n\r\nWill followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you know that\r\nMr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was\r\nevidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added, mournfully.\r\nShe was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation\r\nbetween her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten\r\nwith hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action. But\r\nthe marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all\r\ngiven to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the\r\nidea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon\r\nherself. He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight\r\nthat he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home,\r\nwithout suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too\r\nlittle account with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an\r\nunhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of\r\nany change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he began\r\nto speak again in a tone of mere explanation.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon’s reason is, his displeasure at my taking a position here\r\nwhich he considers unsuited to my rank as his cousin. I have told him\r\nthat I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to\r\nexpect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I\r\nthink ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than\r\na brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its\r\nmeaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to\r\nmake it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity\r\nin any other light.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in the\r\nwrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.\r\n\r\n“It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said, with a\r\ntremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr. Casaubon\r\ndisagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on the lawn, with\r\nmelancholy meditation.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone of\r\nalmost boyish complaint.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, “hardly ever. But\r\nI shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one will tell\r\nme anything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling with an\r\nexquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am always at\r\nLowick.”\r\n\r\n“That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.\r\n\r\n“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression. “I\r\nmean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more\r\nthan my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of\r\nmy own, and it comforts me.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.\r\n\r\n“That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know\r\nwhat it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power\r\nagainst evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with\r\ndarkness narrower.”\r\n\r\n“That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”\r\n\r\n“Please not to call it by any name,” said Dorothea, putting out her\r\nhands entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something else\r\ngeographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with\r\nit. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little\r\ngirl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have\r\ndesires merely for myself, because they may not be good for others, and\r\nI have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite\r\nwell how my days go at Lowick.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather\r\nwondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond\r\nchildren who were talking confidentially of birds.\r\n\r\n“What is _your_ religion?” said Dorothea. “I mean—not what you know\r\nabout religion, but the belief that helps you most?”\r\n\r\n“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I\r\nam a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don’t\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,” said\r\nDorothea, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Now you are subtle,” said Will.\r\n\r\n“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I\r\nwere subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle is! I\r\nmust go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is\r\nexpecting me.”\r\n\r\nWill offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he\r\nwould step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s,\r\nto speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the\r\nleveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove\r\nalong, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his\r\nown control.\r\n\r\n“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I\r\nshould not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t\r\nsay that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a\r\nlittle against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I\r\nhave often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell,\r\nthe Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that\r\ncame across his path when he and his wife were walking out together. He\r\nwas pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.”\r\n\r\n“That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist\r\npreacher, you know. And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypo_crite_\r\nhe is.’ And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like\r\n‘the highest style of man’—as somebody calls the Christian—Young, the\r\npoet Young, I think—you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby\r\nblack gaiters, pleading that he thought the Lord had sent him and his\r\nwife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock it down, though not a\r\nmighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather\r\ncomic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott\r\nmight have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I\r\ncouldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say\r\ngrace over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on\r\nits side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,\r\nit doesn’t do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson\r\nto be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would\r\nnot have been more severe, and yet he comes down on me as if I were the\r\nhardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley’s.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is\r\nwonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we\r\nare blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to\r\nchange their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on\r\ntheir less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing\r\nhow pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never\r\ncomplain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never\r\nbefore looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind\r\nthus sore about the fault-finding of the “Trumpet,” echoed by Sir\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nIt is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine\r\narts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque, might have been\r\ndelighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End: the old house had\r\ndormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked\r\nwith ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and\r\nhalf the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which\r\nthe jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall\r\nwith hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled\r\nsubdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on\r\ninteresting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen\r\ndoor. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the\r\npauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a\r\nwagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy\r\nof cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in\r\nbrown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about\r\nthe uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too\r\nmeagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of\r\na sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which\r\nwe have all paused over as a “charming bit,” touching other\r\nsensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the\r\nagricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen\r\nconstantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome\r\nassociations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled\r\nthe scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,\r\ncarrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver\r\nflattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he\r\nwould not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not\r\nbeen to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the\r\nrare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came\r\nto fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to\r\nhimself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the\r\ncountry, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,\r\nthe stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,\r\nhad seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about\r\nMiddlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have\r\ngood drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well\r\nfollowed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them\r\nthat they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they\r\nonly made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken\r\ntoo much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously\r\ndisturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that\r\nwhatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was\r\nflushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood\r\nstill grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his\r\neasy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other\r\nswinging round a thin walking-stick.\r\n\r\n“Dagley, my good fellow,” began Mr. Brooke, conscious that he was going\r\nto be very friendly about the boy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, ay, I’m a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said\r\nDagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir\r\nfrom his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after\r\nsome outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of\r\nobservation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy tenant\r\nhad probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should not go on,\r\nsince he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to\r\nMrs. Dagley.\r\n\r\n“Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I\r\nhave told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an hour or two,\r\njust to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought home by-and-by,\r\nbefore night: and you’ll just look after him, will you, and give him a\r\nreprimand, you know?”\r\n\r\n“No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please you or\r\nanybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o’ one, and that a\r\nbad un.”\r\n\r\nDagley’s words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back-kitchen\r\ndoor—the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad\r\nweather—and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, “Well, well, I’ll speak to\r\nyour wife—I didn’t mean beating, you know,” turned to walk to the\r\nhouse. But Dagley, only the more inclined to “have his say” with a\r\ngentleman who walked away from him, followed at once, with Fag\r\nslouching at his heels and sullenly evading some small and probably\r\ncharitable advances on the part of Monk.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?” said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. “I\r\ncame to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give him the\r\nstick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly this time.\r\n\r\nOverworked Mrs. Dagley—a thin, worn woman, from whose life pleasure had\r\nso entirely vanished that she had not even any Sunday clothes which\r\ncould give her satisfaction in preparing for church—had already had a\r\nmisunderstanding with her husband since he had come home, and was in\r\nlow spirits, expecting the worst. But her husband was beforehand in\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n“No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,” pursued\r\nDagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit hard. “You’ve\r\ngot no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these primises, as you\r\nwoon’t give a stick tow’rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for _your_\r\ncharrickter.”\r\n\r\n“You’d far better hold your tongue, Dagley,” said the wife, “and not\r\nkick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has been\r\nan’ spent money at market and made himself the worse for liquor, he’s\r\ndone enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what my\r\nboy’s done, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Niver do you mind what he’s done,” said Dagley, more fiercely, “it’s\r\nmy business to speak, an’ not yourn. An’ I wull speak, too. I’ll hev my\r\nsay—supper or no. An’ what I say is, as I’ve lived upo’ your ground\r\nfrom my father and grandfather afore me, an’ hev dropped our money\r\ninto’t, an’ me an’ my children might lie an’ rot on the ground for\r\ntop-dressin’ as we can’t find the money to buy, if the King wasn’t to\r\nput a stop.”\r\n\r\n“My good fellow, you’re drunk, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nconfidentially but not judiciously. “Another day, another day,” he\r\nadded, turning as if to go.\r\n\r\nBut Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled low,\r\nas his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also\r\ndrew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were\r\npausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to\r\nattempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man.\r\n\r\n“I’m no more drunk nor you are, nor so much,” said Dagley. “I can carry\r\nmy liquor, an’ I know what I meean. An’ I meean as the King ’ull put a\r\nstop to ’t, for them say it as knows it, as there’s to be a Rinform,\r\nand them landlords as never done the right thing by their tenants ’ull\r\nbe treated i’ that way as they’ll hev to scuttle off. An’ there’s them\r\ni’ Middlemarch knows what the Rinform is—an’ as knows who’ll hev to\r\nscuttle. Says they, ‘I know who _your_ landlord is.’ An’ says I, ‘I\r\nhope you’re the better for knowin’ him, I arn’t.’ Says they, ‘He’s a\r\nclose-fisted un.’ ‘Ay ay,’ says I. ‘He’s a man for the Rinform,’ says\r\nthey. That’s what they says. An’ I made out what the Rinform were—an’\r\nit were to send you an’ your likes a-scuttlin’ an’ wi’ pretty\r\nstrong-smellin’ things too. An’ you may do as you like now, for I’m\r\nnone afeard on you. An’ you’d better let my boy aloan, an’ look to\r\nyoursen, afore the Rinform has got upo’ your back. That’s what I’n got\r\nto say,” concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his fork into the ground with a\r\nfirmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again.\r\n\r\nAt this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for\r\nMr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could,\r\nin some amazement at the novelty of his situation. He had never been\r\ninsulted on his own land before, and had been inclined to regard\r\nhimself as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think\r\nof our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want\r\nof us). When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he\r\nhad thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking\r\neverything into his own hands.\r\n\r\nSome who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the\r\nmidnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times\r\nthan for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant, in spite\r\nsomehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to\r\nthe backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than\r\nthe rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine\r\nart and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only\r\nthree miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape\r\nknowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of\r\nLondon, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would\r\nhave been if he had learned scant skill in “summing” from the\r\nparish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense\r\ndifficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained\r\nunmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses\r\nsometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to\r\nhim than it had been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely,\r\nthe slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock\r\nand crops, at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to\r\nimply that a man was free to quit it if he chose, but that there was no\r\nearthly “beyond” open to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nWise in his daily work was he:\r\n    To fruits of diligence,\r\nAnd not to faiths or polity,\r\n    He plied his utmost sense.\r\nThese perfect in their little parts,\r\n    Whose work is all their prize—\r\nWithout them how could laws, or arts,\r\n    Or towered cities rise?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn watching effects, if only of an electric battery, it is often\r\nnecessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or group\r\nat some distance from the point where the movement we are interested in\r\nwas set up. The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth’s\r\nbreakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were:\r\nfather, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now at home\r\nwaiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to her, was\r\ngetting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his\r\nfather’s disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling\r\n“business.”\r\n\r\nThe letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman had\r\nbeen paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and\r\ntoast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other,\r\nsometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes screwing up his mouth in\r\ninward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,\r\nwhich Letty snatched up like an eager terrier.\r\n\r\nThe talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed\r\nCaleb’s absorption except shaking the table when he was writing.\r\n\r\nTwo letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she had\r\npassed them to her mother, and sat playing with her tea-spoon absently,\r\ntill with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing, which she\r\nhad kept on her lap during breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t sew, Mary!” said Ben, pulling her arm down. “Make me a\r\npeacock with this bread-crumb.” He had been kneading a small mass for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Mischief!” said Mary, good-humoredly, while she pricked his\r\nhand lightly with her needle. “Try and mould it yourself: you have seen\r\nme do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is for Rosamond\r\nVincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without\r\nthis handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t she, Mary?” said Letty, seriously interested in this\r\nmystery, and pushing her head so close to her sister that Mary now\r\nturned the threatening needle towards Letty’s nose.\r\n\r\n“Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only be\r\neleven,” said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that Letty sank\r\nback with a sense of knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Have you made up your mind, my dear?” said Mrs. Garth, laying the\r\nletters down.\r\n\r\n“I shall go to the school at York,” said Mary. “I am less unfit to\r\nteach in a school than in a family. I like to teach classes best. And,\r\nyou see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done.”\r\n\r\n“Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,” said Mrs.\r\nGarth, with a touch of rebuke in her tone. “I could understand your\r\nobjection to it if you had not knowledge enough, Mary, or if you\r\ndisliked children.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like,\r\nmother,” said Mary, rather curtly. “I am not fond of a schoolroom: I\r\nlike the outside world better. It is a very inconvenient fault of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“It must be very stupid to be always in a girls’ school,” said Alfred.\r\n“Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard’s pupils walking two and\r\ntwo.”\r\n\r\n“And they have no games worth playing at,” said Jim. “They can neither\r\nthrow nor leap. I don’t wonder at Mary’s not liking it.”\r\n\r\n“What is that Mary doesn’t like, eh?” said the father, looking over his\r\nspectacles and pausing before he opened his next letter.\r\n\r\n“Being among a lot of nincompoop girls,” said Alfred.\r\n\r\n“Is it the situation you had heard of, Mary?” said Caleb, gently,\r\nlooking at his daughter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it. It is\r\nquite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching\r\nthe smallest strummers at the piano.”\r\n\r\n“Poor child! I wish she could stay at home with us, Susan,” said Caleb,\r\nlooking plaintively at his wife.\r\n\r\n“Mary would not be happy without doing her duty,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\nmagisterially, conscious of having done her own.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that,” said\r\nAlfred—at which Mary and her father laughed silently, but Mrs. Garth\r\nsaid, gravely—\r\n\r\n“Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that\r\nyou think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could help you to go to\r\nMr. Hanmer’s with the money she gets?”\r\n\r\n“That seems to me a great shame. But she’s an old brick,” said Alfred,\r\nrising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to kiss her.\r\n\r\nMary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were\r\ncoming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles of his\r\neyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he\r\nreturned to the opening of his letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her lips\r\ncurling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to\r\npass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang,\r\n“She’s an old brick, old brick, old brick!” to a cantering measure,\r\nwhich he beat out with his fist on Mary’s arm.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Garth’s eyes were now drawn towards her husband, who was\r\nalready deep in the letter he was reading. His face had an expression\r\nof grave surprise, which alarmed her a little, but he did not like to\r\nbe questioned while he was reading, and she remained anxiously watching\r\ntill she saw him suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he turned\r\nback to the beginning of the letter, and looking at her above his\r\nspectacles, said, in a low tone, “What do you think, Susan?”\r\n\r\nShe went and stood behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder, while\r\nthey read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam, offering\r\nto Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and\r\nelsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke\r\nof Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same\r\ntime to resume the agency of the Tipton property. The Baronet added in\r\nvery obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing\r\nthe Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he hoped\r\nto be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms\r\nagreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at\r\ntwelve o’clock on the following day.\r\n\r\n“He writes handsomely, doesn’t he, Susan?” said Caleb, turning his eyes\r\nupward to his wife, who raised her hand from his shoulder to his ear,\r\nwhile she rested her chin on his head. “Brooke didn’t like to ask me\r\nhimself, I can see,” he continued, laughing silently.\r\n\r\n“Here is an honor to your father, children,” said Mrs. Garth, looking\r\nround at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents. “He is asked\r\nto take a post again by those who dismissed him long ago. That shows\r\nthat he did his work well, so that they feel the want of him.”\r\n\r\n“Like Cincinnatus—hooray!” said Ben, riding on his chair, with a\r\npleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.\r\n\r\n“Will they come to fetch him, mother?” said Letty, thinking of the\r\nMayor and Corporation in their robes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth patted Letty’s head and smiled, but seeing that her husband\r\nwas gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that\r\nsanctuary “business,” she pressed his shoulder and said emphatically—\r\n\r\n“Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be\r\nunreasonable to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to between\r\nfour and five hundred, the two together.” Then with a little start of\r\nremembrance he said, “Mary, write and give up that school. Stay and\r\nhelp your mother. I’m as pleased as Punch, now I’ve thought of that.”\r\n\r\nNo manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than\r\nCaleb’s, but his talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he was\r\nvery particular about his letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a\r\ntreasury of correct language.\r\n\r\nThere was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the\r\ncambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be\r\nput out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance. Mrs. Garth,\r\nin placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb\r\npushing his chair from the table, as if he were going to move to the\r\ndesk, still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the\r\nground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his left hand,\r\naccording to a mute language of his own. At last he said—\r\n\r\n“It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan. I shall\r\nwant help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the engineering—I’ve\r\nmade up my mind to that.” He fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric\r\nagain for a little while, and then continued: “I shall make Brooke have\r\nnew agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a rotation of\r\ncrops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at\r\nBott’s corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.\r\nIt’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would be glad to\r\ndo it for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.\r\n\r\n“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the\r\nnature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country\r\ninto good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with\r\ntheir farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building\r\ndone—that those who are living and those who come after will be the\r\nbetter for. I’d sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most\r\nhonorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust his\r\nfingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat upright, but\r\npresently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head\r\nslowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will\r\nbe a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work:\r\na father whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She\r\ncould not say any more to him then about the pay.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was\r\nseated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs.\r\nGarth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was\r\nwhispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the\r\norchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the\r\ntufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his\r\nparishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to\r\nLydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding\r\nthe Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother\r\nthat Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,\r\nyou see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though\r\nless of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In\r\nthose days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But\r\nthe Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no\r\nsurprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he\r\nwas shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have\r\nsomething to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is,\r\npoor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with\r\nhis bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken\r\nme into his confidence.”\r\n\r\nMary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s\r\nconfidence had gone.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think\r\nwhat was become of him.”\r\n\r\n“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a\r\nlittle too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor\r\nfellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and poured\r\nhimself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have seen him grow\r\nup from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house\r\nthat the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a\r\ndifficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come and\r\ntell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his\r\ndebt to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come\r\nhimself even to bid you good by.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand.\r\n“We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as\r\nrich as a Jew.”\r\n\r\n“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are\r\ngoing to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and\r\nperhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the\r\nsame family connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once\r\nset going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw\r\nback his head a little, and spread his arms on the elbows of his\r\nchair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the letting of the land,\r\nand carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It’s a most\r\nuncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan, to sit on\r\nhorseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able\r\nto put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into\r\npolitics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement\r\nover only a few hundred acres.”\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his\r\nhappiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the\r\nwords came without effort.\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is the best\r\nsort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he dwelt a\r\ngood deal on the injury he had done you in causing you to part with\r\nmoney—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for other purposes. I\r\nwish Fred were not such an idle dog; he has some very good points, and\r\nhis father is a little hard upon him.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.\r\n\r\n“He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to study\r\nbefore term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter\r\nthe Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass,\r\nthat will be some guarantee that he has energy and a will; and he is\r\nquite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So far he will please\r\nhis father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile\r\nVincy to his son’s adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly\r\nhe is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to\r\nhinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He\r\nquoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do you remember it?” (Mr.\r\nFarebrother used to say “Mary” instead of “Miss Garth,” but it was part\r\nof his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according\r\nto Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she worked for her bread.)\r\n\r\nMary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,\r\nanswered at once, “I have said so many impertinent things to Fred—we\r\nare such old playfellows.”\r\n\r\n“You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous\r\nclergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that\r\nwas so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”\r\n\r\nCaleb laughed. “She gets her tongue from you, Susan,” he said, with\r\nsome enjoyment.\r\n\r\n“Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that her\r\nmother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my\r\nflippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n\r\n“It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,” said Mrs. Garth, with whom\r\nspeaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. “We should not value\r\nour Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the next\r\nparish.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something in what she says, though,” said Caleb, not disposed\r\nto have Mary’s sharpness undervalued. “A bad workman of any sort makes\r\nhis fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,” he added, looking on the\r\nfloor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were\r\nscantier than thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Clearly,” said the Vicar, amused. “By being contemptible we set men’s\r\nminds to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth’s view\r\nof the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to Fred\r\nVincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old\r\nFeatherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was\r\nsomething quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But\r\nFred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most\r\nabout is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never\r\nthink well of him again.”\r\n\r\n“I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with decision.\r\n“But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he gives me good\r\nreason to do so.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we must forgive young people when they’re sorry,” said Caleb,\r\nwatching Mary close the door. “And as you say, Mr. Farebrother, there\r\nwas the very devil in that old man. Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell\r\nyou a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it\r\nagain. The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very\r\nnight he died, when she was sitting up with him by herself, and he\r\noffered her a sum of money that he had in the box by him if she would\r\ndo it. But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing—would not be\r\nhandling his iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted\r\nburnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred\r\nVincy would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him\r\nat the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she was\r\nin the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says, much as if\r\nshe had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it against her\r\nwill, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel with her,\r\nsomehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of\r\nbearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be glad to do it.\r\nNow, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree with me; she\r\nsays—tell what you say, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what would\r\nbe the effect on Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her work, and\r\nlooking at Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls\r\non another because we have done right is not to lie upon our\r\nconscience.”\r\n\r\nThe Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the\r\nfeeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You don’t\r\nmean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of the way;\r\nbut it goes through you, when it’s done.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.\r\nFarebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than\r\nto speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred\r\nis wrong—or rather, mistaken—though no man ought to make a claim on\r\nsuch feeling.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Caleb, “it’s a secret. You will not tell Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news—that you can\r\nafford the loss he caused you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the\r\norchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a pretty\r\npicture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the\r\napples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her lavender gingham and\r\nblack ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin\r\npicked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how\r\nMary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded\r\nstreet to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among\r\nthose daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out\r\nnecks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix\r\nyour eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet\r\ncarriage, who looks about her, but does not suppose that anybody is\r\nlooking at her. If she has a broad face and square brow, well-marked\r\neyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her\r\nglance which her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features\r\nentirely insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person\r\nfor a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you\r\nperfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her\r\nvoice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever\r\ntasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget\r\nit. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his\r\nwell-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the\r\nopportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a foolish thing,\r\nthough she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings\r\nwere more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother’s unwise\r\ndoings. At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of\r\nthe Vicar’s clerical character never seemed to call forth the same\r\nscorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted\r\nimperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These\r\nirregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds\r\nthan Mary Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and\r\ndemerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of\r\nthose widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s\r\ntenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on, or the\r\ncontrary?\r\n\r\n“Have you any message for your old playfellow, Miss Garth?” said the\r\nVicar, as he took a fragrant apple from the basket which she held\r\ntowards him, and put it in his pocket. “Something to soften down that\r\nharsh judgment? I am going straight to see him.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary, shaking her head, and smiling. “If I were to say that\r\nhe would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that he would be\r\nsomething worse than ridiculous. But I am very glad to hear that he is\r\ngoing away to work.”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going\r\naway to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you will\r\ncome to see her at the vicarage: you know she is fond of having young\r\npeople to talk to, and she has a great deal to tell about old times.\r\nYou will really be doing a kindness.”\r\n\r\n“I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary. “Everything seems\r\ntoo happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be part of my\r\nlife to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather\r\nempty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?”\r\n\r\n“May I go with you, Mary?” whispered Letty—a most inconvenient child,\r\nwho listened to everything. But she was made exultant by having her\r\nchin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother—an incident which\r\nshe narrated to her mother and father.\r\n\r\nAs the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him closely might have\r\nseen him twice shrug his shoulders. I think that the rare Englishmen\r\nwho have this gesture are never of the heavy type—for fear of any\r\nlumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; they have\r\nusually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller\r\nerrors of men (themselves inclusive). The Vicar was holding an inward\r\ndialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something\r\nmore between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,\r\nand replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a\r\ngreat deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to\r\nthis was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely\r\nto have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,\r\nadded he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon\r\nfollowed the second shrug.\r\n\r\nWhat could two men, so different from each other, see in this “brown\r\npatch,” as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her plainness that\r\nattracted them (and let all plain young ladies be warned against the\r\ndangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want\r\nof beauty). A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very\r\nwonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences:\r\nand charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, “Susan, guess\r\nwhat I’m thinking of.”\r\n\r\n“The rotation of crops,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him, above her\r\nknitting, “or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Caleb, gravely; “I am thinking that I could do a great turn\r\nfor Fred Vincy. Christy’s gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will\r\nbe five years before Jim is ready to take to business. I shall want\r\nhelp, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act\r\nunder me, and it might be the making of him into a useful man, if he\r\ngives up being a parson. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think, there is hardly anything honest that his family would object\r\nto more,” said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.\r\n\r\n“What care I about their objecting?” said Caleb, with a sturdiness\r\nwhich he was apt to show when he had an opinion. “The lad is of age and\r\nmust get his bread. He has sense enough and quickness enough; he likes\r\nbeing on the land, and it’s my belief that he could learn business well\r\nif he gave his mind to it.”\r\n\r\n“But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman,\r\nand I think he has the same sort of feeling himself. They all think us\r\nbeneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Mrs. Vincy\r\nwould say that we wanted Fred for Mary.”\r\n\r\n“Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort,”\r\nsaid Caleb, with disgust.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb.”\r\n\r\n“I call it improper pride to let fools’ notions hinder you from doing a\r\ngood action. There’s no sort of work,” said Caleb, with fervor, putting\r\nout his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis, “that\r\ncould ever be done well, if you minded what fools say. You must have it\r\ninside you that your plan is right, and that plan you must follow.”\r\n\r\n“I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,” said\r\nMrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points\r\non which her mild husband was yet firmer. “Still, it seems to be fixed\r\nthat Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and\r\nsee what he will choose to do after that? It is not easy to keep people\r\nagainst their will. And you are not yet quite sure enough of your own\r\nposition, or what you will want.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it may be better to wait a bit. But as to my getting plenty of\r\nwork for two, I’m pretty sure of that. I’ve always had my hands full\r\nwith scattered things, and there’s always something fresh turning up.\r\nWhy, only yesterday—bless me, I don’t think I told you!—it was rather\r\nodd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the\r\nsame bit of valuing. And who do you think they were?” said Caleb,\r\ntaking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his fingers, as if it\r\nwere a part of his exposition. He was fond of a pinch when it occurred\r\nto him, but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command.\r\n\r\nHis wife held down her knitting and looked attentive.\r\n\r\n“Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode was\r\nbefore him, so I’m going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it’s mortgage\r\nor purchase they’re going for, I can’t tell yet.”\r\n\r\n“Can that man be going to sell the land just left him—which he has\r\ntaken the name for?” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n\r\n“Deuce knows,” said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of\r\ndiscreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce. “But Bulstrode\r\nhas long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under his\r\nfingers—that I know. And it’s a difficult matter to get, in this part\r\nof the country.”\r\n\r\nCaleb scattered his snuff carefully instead of taking it, and then\r\nadded, “The ins and outs of things are curious. Here is the land\r\nthey’ve been all along expecting for Fred, which it seems the old man\r\nnever meant to leave him a foot of, but left it to this side-slip of a\r\nson that he kept in the dark, and thought of his sticking there and\r\nvexing everybody as well as he could have vexed ’em himself if he could\r\nhave kept alive. I say, it would be curious if it got into Bulstrode’s\r\nhands after all. The old man hated him, and never would bank with him.”\r\n\r\n“What reason could the miserable creature have for hating a man whom he\r\nhad nothing to do with?” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! where’s the use of asking for such fellows’ reasons? The soul of\r\nman,” said Caleb, with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which\r\nalways came when he used this phrase—“The soul of man, when it gets\r\nfairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous toad-stools, and no\r\neye can see whence came the seed thereof.”\r\n\r\nIt was one of Caleb’s quaintnesses, that in his difficulty of finding\r\nspeech for his thought, he caught, as it were, snatches of diction\r\nwhich he associated with various points of view or states of mind; and\r\nwhenever he had a feeling of awe, he was haunted by a sense of Biblical\r\nphraseology, though he could hardly have given a strict quotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nBy swaggering could I never thrive,\r\nFor the rain it raineth every day.\r\n—_Twelfth Night_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward\r\nbetween Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the\r\nland attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the interchange of a\r\nletter or two between these personages.\r\n\r\nWho shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens to have\r\nbeen cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on a forsaken\r\nbeach, or “rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many\r\nconquests,” it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and\r\nother scandals gossiped about long empires ago:—this world being\r\napparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such conditions are often\r\nminutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has\r\nbeen kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links\r\nof effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at\r\nlast fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink\r\nand paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at\r\nlast be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge\r\nenough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching\r\nthe progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be\r\njust as much of a coincidence as the other.\r\n\r\nHaving made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling\r\nattention to the existence of low people by whose interference, however\r\nlittle we may like it, the course of the world is very much determined.\r\nIt would be well, certainly, if we could help to reduce their number,\r\nand something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to\r\ntheir existence. Socially speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been\r\ngenerally pronounced a superfluity. But those who like Peter\r\nFeatherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded, are the very last\r\nto wait for such a request either in prose or verse. The copy in this\r\ncase bore more of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex\r\nfrog-features, accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded\r\nfigure, are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers.\r\nThe result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no\r\norder of intelligent beings. Especially when he is suddenly brought\r\ninto evidence to frustrate other people’s expectations—the very lowest\r\naspect in which a social superfluity can present himself.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s low characteristics were all of the sober,\r\nwater-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he\r\nwas always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he resembled, and old\r\nPeter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating,\r\nand far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that his\r\nfinger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry\r\na well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good,\r\nand whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.\r\nThus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen;\r\nthough his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a\r\nclerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. He\r\nthought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people, and they in\r\ntheir turn regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an\r\nexaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother Peter, and still\r\nmore Peter’s property, should have had such belongings.\r\n\r\nThe garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the\r\nwainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now,\r\nwhen Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his hands behind him, looking\r\nout on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether he\r\nlooked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a\r\nperson who stood in the middle of the room, with his legs considerably\r\napart and his hands in his trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a\r\ncontrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. He was a man obviously on the way\r\ntowards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy\r\nwhiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to\r\ndisadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of\r\na swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of\r\nfireworks, regarding his own remarks on any other person’s performance\r\nas likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.\r\n\r\nHis name was John Raffles, and he sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after\r\nhis signature, observing when he did so, that he was once taught by\r\nLeonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his name, and that he,\r\nRaffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal\r\nBa-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles,\r\nboth of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers’ rooms in the\r\ncommercial hotels of that period.\r\n\r\n“Come, now, Josh,” he was saying, in a full rumbling tone, “look at it\r\nin this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years,\r\nand you could afford something handsome now to make her comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Not while you live. Nothing would make her comfortable while you\r\nlive,” returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. “What I give her, you’ll\r\ntake.”\r\n\r\n“You bear me a grudge, Josh, that I know. But come, now—as between man\r\nand man—without humbug—a little capital might enable me to make a\r\nfirst-rate thing of the shop. The tobacco trade is growing. I should\r\ncut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it. I should stick\r\nto it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always be on\r\nthe spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy. I’ve pretty\r\nwell done with my wild oats—turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in\r\nmy chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to the tobacco trade, I could\r\nbring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not\r\nbe found elsewhere in a hurry. I don’t want to be bothering you one\r\ntime after another, but to get things once for all into the right\r\nchannel. Consider that, Josh—as between man and man—and with your poor\r\nmother to be made easy for her life. I was always fond of the old\r\nwoman, by Jove!”\r\n\r\n“Have you done?” said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“Yes, _I_’ve done,” said Raffles, taking hold of his hat which stood\r\nbefore him on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push.\r\n\r\n“Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall\r\nbelieve it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall\r\nhave for never doing it. Do you think I mean to forget your kicking me\r\nwhen I was a lad, and eating all the best victual away from me and my\r\nmother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to sell and\r\npocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I\r\nshould be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. My mother was a\r\nfool to you: she’d no right to give me a father-in-law, and she’s been\r\npunished for it. She shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more:\r\nand that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises\r\nagain, or to come into this country after me again. The next time you\r\nshow yourself inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the\r\ndogs and the wagoner’s whip.”\r\n\r\nAs Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles\r\nwith his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as it\r\ncould have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging\r\nkickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms\r\nand back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and\r\nauditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles\r\nwould retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a\r\ngrimace which was habitual with him whenever he was “out” in a game;\r\nthen subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful of\r\nbrandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor bright!\r\nI’ll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!”\r\n\r\n“Mind,” said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, “if I ever see you\r\nagain, I shan’t speak to you. I don’t own you any more than if I saw a\r\ncrow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a\r\ncharacter for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head\r\nand wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed. “I’m very fond\r\nof you; _by_ Jove, I am! There’s nothing I like better than plaguing\r\nyou—you’re so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the\r\nbrandy and the sovereign’s a bargain.”\r\n\r\nHe jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau\r\nwith his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with\r\nthe flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather\r\ncovering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within\r\nthe fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make\r\nthe glass firm.\r\n\r\nBy that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,\r\nand handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor speaking to\r\nhim. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to the window and\r\ngazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the\r\ninterview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed\r\nit up, and deposited it in his side-pocket, with provoking slowness,\r\nmaking a grimace at his stepson’s back.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his head as\r\nhe opened the door.\r\n\r\nRigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had\r\nturned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the\r\ngrassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were\r\nloading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait\r\nof a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,\r\nlooked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he\r\nhad been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to\r\nstare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of\r\nhis appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be overtaken\r\nby the stage-coach, which carried him to Brassing; and there he took\r\nthe new-made railway, observing to his fellow-passengers that he\r\nconsidered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson. Mr.\r\nRaffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at\r\nan academy, and being able, if he chose, to pass well everywhere;\r\nindeed, there was not one of his fellow-men whom he did not feel\r\nhimself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the\r\nentertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nHe played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been\r\nentirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to his flask. The\r\npaper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed _Nicholas\r\nBulstrode_, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present\r\nuseful position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nHow much, methinks, I could despise this man\r\nWere I not bound in charity against it!\r\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Henry VIII_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his return\r\nfrom his wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence of a\r\nletter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his\r\nillness to Lydgate, nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as\r\nto how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life. On\r\nthis point, as on all others, he shrank from pity; and if the suspicion\r\nof being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of\r\nhimself was embittering, the idea of calling forth a show of compassion\r\nby frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable\r\nto him. Every proud mind knows something of this experience, and\r\nperhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough\r\nto make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of\r\nexalting.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the\r\nquestion of his health and life haunted his silence with a more\r\nharassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his\r\nauthorship. It is true that this last might be called his central\r\nambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the\r\nlargest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the\r\nconsciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks\r\namid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way\r\nwith Mr. Casaubon’s hard intellectual labors. Their most characteristic\r\nresult was not the “Key to all Mythologies,” but a morbid consciousness\r\nthat others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably\r\nmerited—a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of\r\nhim were not to his advantage—a melancholy absence of passion in his\r\nefforts at achievement, and a passionate resistance to the confession\r\nthat he had achieved nothing.\r\n\r\nThus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed\r\nand dried him, was really no security against wounds, least of all\r\nagainst those which came from Dorothea. And he had begun now to frame\r\npossibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him\r\nthan anything his mind had dwelt on before.\r\n\r\nAgainst certain facts he was helpless: against Will Ladislaw’s\r\nexistence, his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his\r\nflippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,\r\nwell-stamped erudition: against Dorothea’s nature, always taking on\r\nsome new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and silence\r\ncovering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of: against\r\ncertain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in\r\nrelation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her. There\r\nwas no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as\r\nhe could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out to be\r\nsomething more troublesome than he had conceived. She nursed him, she\r\nread to him, she anticipated his wants, and was solicitous about his\r\nfeelings; but there had entered into the husband’s mind the certainty\r\nthat she judged him, and that her wifely devotedness was like a\r\npenitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts—was accompanied with a\r\npower of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too\r\nluminously as a part of things in general. His discontent passed\r\nvapor-like through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to\r\nthat inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because it\r\nseemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him with\r\nperfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife; and early\r\ninstances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no\r\ntenderness and submission afterwards could remove. To his suspicious\r\ninterpretation Dorothea’s silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a\r\nremark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an\r\nassertion of conscious superiority; her gentle answers had an\r\nirritating cautiousness in them; and when she acquiesced it was a\r\nself-approved effort of forbearance. The tenacity with which he strove\r\nto hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him; as we hear\r\nwith the more keenness what we wish others not to hear.\r\n\r\nInstead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I think\r\nit quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot\r\nout the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the\r\nblot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And who, if Mr. Casaubon\r\nhad chosen to expound his discontents—his suspicions that he was not\r\nany longer adored without criticism—could have denied that they were\r\nfounded on good reasons? On the contrary, there was a strong reason to\r\nbe added, which he had not himself taken explicitly into\r\naccount—namely, that he was not unmixedly adorable. He suspected this,\r\nhowever, as he suspected other things, without confessing it, and like\r\nthe rest of us, felt how soothing it would have been to have a\r\ncompanion who would never find it out.\r\n\r\nThis sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly\r\nprepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had\r\noccurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon’s power of suspicious\r\nconstruction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he knew,\r\nhe added imaginary facts both present and future which became more real\r\nto him than those because they called up a stronger dislike, a more\r\npredominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw’s\r\nintentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s impressions, were\r\nconstantly at their weaving work. It would be quite unjust to him to\r\nsuppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of\r\nDorothea: his own habits of mind and conduct, quite as much as the open\r\nelevation of her nature, saved him from any such mistake. What he was\r\njealous of was her opinion, the sway that might be given to her ardent\r\nmind in its judgments, and the future possibilities to which these\r\nmight lead her. As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had\r\nnothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him,\r\nhe felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any\r\ndesign which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined\r\nimpulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s\r\nreturn from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood;\r\nand he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently\r\nencouraged this course. It was as clear as possible that she was ready\r\nto be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had\r\nnever had a _tête-à-tête_ without her bringing away from it some new\r\ntroublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was\r\naware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first\r\ntime been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which\r\nroused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known\r\nbefore. Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the\r\ndarkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more\r\nodious foreboding into her husband’s mind.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present\r\nwith him. He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual\r\npower of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there\r\nmight still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would\r\njustify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the\r\nsweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &\r\nCompany; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the\r\ntombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and\r\ninterrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake,\r\nso that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of\r\nindigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,\r\nwhich the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all\r\neternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,\r\nthe prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter\r\nsavors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less\r\nsurprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other\r\npersons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a\r\npotently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some\r\nundermining disease was at work within him, there might be large\r\nopportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if\r\none of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so\r\nstrongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his\r\ndisembodied existence.\r\n\r\nThis is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the\r\ncase. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we know,\r\nhad a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the\r\nrequirements of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons for\r\nhis conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in which\r\nMr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had\r\nto care for her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is not\r\nto be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the\r\ncontrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose\r\nher to the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to\r\nplay adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic\r\nenthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a\r\nman with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a\r\npersonal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed\r\nby the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly\r\nvented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.\r\nEven if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may\r\nattempt through indirect influence. This man has gained Dorothea’s ear:\r\nhe has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her\r\nmind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for\r\nhim. If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will\r\npersuade her to marry him. That would be calamity for her and success\r\nfor him. _She_ would not think it calamity: he would make her believe\r\nanything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she\r\ninwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is\r\noccupied with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and of\r\nentering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be\r\nfatal to Dorothea. Has he ever persisted in anything except from\r\ncontradiction? In knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small\r\ncost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him, the facile\r\necho of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from\r\nlaxity? I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to\r\nthe utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”\r\n\r\nThe arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong\r\nmeasures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably\r\ndwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to\r\nget the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud\r\nreticence, and had determined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the\r\nnature of his illness.\r\n\r\nHe had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at\r\nhalf-past three, and in answer to her anxious question, whether he had\r\nfelt ill, replied,—“No, I merely wish to have his opinion concerning\r\nsome habitual symptoms. You need not see him, my dear. I shall give\r\norders that he may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be\r\ntaking my usual exercise.”\r\n\r\nWhen Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly\r\nreceding with his hands behind him according to his habit, and his head\r\nbent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty\r\nlimes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the\r\nlights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the\r\ncawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that\r\nlast solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame\r\nin its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely\r\nsoon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him showed more\r\nmarkedly than ever the signs of premature age—the student’s bent\r\nshoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.\r\n“Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one\r\ncan tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, with his invariably polite air, “I am\r\nexceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We will, if you\r\nplease, carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.”\r\n\r\n“I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant\r\nsymptoms,” said Lydgate, filling up a pause.\r\n\r\n“Not immediately—no. In order to account for that wish I must\r\nmention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life, on\r\nall collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance\r\nfrom the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its\r\nbest years. In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would fain\r\nleave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be committed\r\nto the press by—others. Were I assured that this is the utmost I can\r\nreasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of\r\nmy attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative\r\ndetermination of my course.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it\r\nbetween the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a mind largely\r\ninstructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more\r\ninteresting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured\r\naddress, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.\r\nNay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle\r\nof the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the\r\nsignificance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the\r\nwaters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was\r\nnothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,\r\nwho had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little\r\namusement mingling with his pity. He was at present too ill acquainted\r\nwith disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is\r\nbelow the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the\r\nsufferer.\r\n\r\n“You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?” he said,\r\nwishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon’s purpose, which seemed to be\r\nclogged by some hesitation.\r\n\r\n“I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am bound to\r\ntestify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal\r\ndisease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the truth\r\nwithout reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement of your\r\nconclusions: I request it as a friendly service. If you can tell me\r\nthat my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary\r\ncasualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have already indicated.\r\nIf not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the\r\nfirst thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly\r\nuncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because\r\ndiseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.\r\nIn any case, one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous\r\nuncertainty of life.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.\r\n\r\n“I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty\r\ndegeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and\r\nexplored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very\r\nmany years ago. A good deal of experience—a more lengthened\r\nobservation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said, it\r\nis my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden. At\r\nthe same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may be\r\nconsistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years,\r\nor even more. I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or\r\nmedical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same\r\npoint.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain\r\nspeech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr.\r\nCasaubon as a tribute of respect.\r\n\r\n“I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s pause.\r\n“One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have\r\nnow told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to\r\nexplain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an\r\nunmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand slightly,\r\nand said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on the rare beauty\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nLydgate, certain that his patient wished to be alone, soon left him;\r\nand the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued\r\nto pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship\r\nin melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted\r\nacross the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as in the presence\r\nof a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself\r\nlooking into the eyes of death—who was passing through one of those\r\nrare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,\r\nwhich is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of\r\nwaters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the\r\nwater which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the\r\ncommonplace “We must all die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute\r\nconsciousness “I must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his\r\nfingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as\r\nour mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be\r\nlike the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found\r\nhimself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming\r\noar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an\r\nhour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward\r\nin imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward—perhaps with\r\nthe divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of\r\nself-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias his acts will give us a\r\nclew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly\r\nreservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and\r\nhopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call\r\nit a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which\r\nmen drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.\r\nAnd Mr. Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and\r\nlight divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor\r\nman, clung low and mist-like in very shady places.\r\n\r\nDorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she had\r\nstepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.\r\nBut she hesitated, fearing to offend him by obtruding herself; for her\r\nardor, continually repulsed, served, with her intense memory, to\r\nheighten her dread, as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder; and she\r\nwandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she saw him\r\nadvancing. Then she went towards him, and might have represented a\r\nheaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining\r\nshould yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to\r\na comprehended grief. His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she\r\nfelt her timidity increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to\r\ncling with difficulty against his rigid arm.\r\n\r\nThere was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this\r\nunresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word, but not\r\ntoo strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of\r\njoy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard\r\nfaces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth\r\nbears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge. You may\r\nask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in\r\nthat way. Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity: have you\r\never watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is\r\npressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either\r\nactual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying? Besides,\r\nhe knew little of Dorothea’s sensations, and had not reflected that on\r\nsuch an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his\r\nown sensibilities about Carp’s criticisms.\r\n\r\nDorothea did not withdraw her arm, but she could not venture to speak.\r\nMr. Casaubon did not say, “I wish to be alone,” but he directed his\r\nsteps in silence towards the house, and as they entered by the glass\r\ndoor on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew her arm and lingered on\r\nthe matting, that she might leave her husband quite free. He entered\r\nthe library and shut himself in, alone with his sorrow.\r\n\r\nShe went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene glory\r\nof the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast long\r\nshadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She threw herself on a\r\nchair, not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun-rays: if there were\r\ndiscomfort in that, how could she tell that it was not part of her\r\ninward misery?\r\n\r\nShe was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had\r\nfelt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came words:—\r\n\r\n“What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never knows\r\nwhat is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of anything I do? He\r\nwishes he had never married me.”\r\n\r\nShe began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one who\r\nhas lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one glance all the\r\npaths of her young hope which she should never find again. And just as\r\nclearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s\r\nsolitude—how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him.\r\nIf he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed\r\nhim—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him\r\nsimply a part of her own life. Now she said bitterly, “It is his fault,\r\nnot mine.” In the jar of her whole being, Pity was overthrown. Was it\r\nher fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his\r\nworthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?— She was able enough to estimate\r\nhim—she who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best\r\nsoul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that she might be petty\r\nenough to please him. In such a crisis as this, some women begin to\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nThe sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down\r\nagain, but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not\r\nwell and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never deliberately\r\nallowed her resentment to govern her in this way before, but she\r\nbelieved now that she could not see him again without telling him the\r\ntruth about her feeling, and she must wait till she could do it without\r\ninterruption. He might wonder and be hurt at her message. It was good\r\nthat he should wonder and be hurt. Her anger said, as anger is apt to\r\nsay, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with\r\nspirits watching them, must be on her side. She had determined to ring\r\nher bell, when there came a rap at the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the\r\nlibrary. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.\r\n\r\n“I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room, but pray\r\ndo not disturb me again.”\r\n\r\nDorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while the\r\nevening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed\r\ncontinually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards\r\nstriking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy that\r\nwould animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved\r\nsubmission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself. That\r\nthought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her\r\nconviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his\r\nwork, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long\r\nwithout rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking\r\nat her anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her a litany of pictured\r\nsorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those\r\nsorrows—but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was\r\nstill, and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon\r\nhabitually went to rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside\r\nin the darkness waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his\r\nhand. If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and\r\neven risk incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything\r\nelse. But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light\r\nadvanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the\r\ncarpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his face\r\nwas more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up\r\nat him beseechingly, without speaking.\r\n\r\n“Dorothea!” he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. “Were you\r\nwaiting for me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”\r\n\r\n“Come, my dear, come. You are young, and need not to extend your life\r\nby watching.”\r\n\r\nWhen the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea’s ears,\r\nshe felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we\r\nhad narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put her hand into\r\nher husband’s, and they went along the broad corridor together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\nTHE DEAD HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n“This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love\r\nAges ago in finest ivory;\r\nNought modish in it, pure and noble lines\r\nOf generous womanhood that fits all time\r\nThat too is costly ware; majolica\r\nOf deft design, to please a lordly eye:\r\nThe smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful\r\nAs mere Faience! a table ornament\r\nTo suit the richest mounting.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did occasionally\r\ndrive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity\r\nsuch as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three\r\nmiles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she\r\ndetermined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see\r\nLydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any\r\ndepressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and\r\nwhether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She felt\r\nalmost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the\r\ndread of being without it—the dread of that ignorance which would make\r\nher unjust or hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some\r\ncrisis in her husband’s mind she was certain: he had the very next day\r\nbegun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite\r\nnewly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores\r\nof patience.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in Lowick\r\nGate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she\r\nhad written beforehand. And he was not at home.\r\n\r\n“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew\r\nof, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,\r\nMrs. Lydgate was at home.\r\n\r\n“I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me. Will you ask her\r\nif she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”\r\n\r\nWhen the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear\r\nsounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice\r\nand then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off\r\nsuddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would\r\nbe happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.\r\n\r\nWhen the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a\r\nsort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the\r\ndifferent ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us\r\nexactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild\r\nautumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the\r\neye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the\r\nsweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging\r\nall out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a still audience\r\nas Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right\r\nenough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her\r\nsimply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then\r\nin the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold\r\ntrencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no\r\ndramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.\r\nCasaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing\r\nwith Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or\r\nappearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without\r\nsatisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying\r\n_her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the\r\nbest judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at\r\nSir Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she\r\nmust make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her\r\nusual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely\r\nbride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but\r\nseeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was\r\ntoo much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the\r\ncontrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been\r\nstriking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were\r\non a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous\r\ncrown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so\r\nperfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large\r\nembroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know\r\nthe price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that\r\ncontrolled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive\r\nsubstitute for simplicity.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said Dorothea,\r\nimmediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go\r\nhome, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find\r\nhim, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.”\r\n\r\n“He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how soon he\r\nwill come home. But I can send for him.”\r\n\r\n“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.\r\nHe had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored\r\nwith surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable\r\npleasure, saying—\r\n\r\n“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”\r\n\r\n“May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see\r\nhim?” said Will.\r\n\r\n“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if\r\nyou will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”\r\n\r\nWill was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an\r\ninstant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will\r\ngo myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again.\r\nI will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me,\r\nMrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.”\r\n\r\nHer mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left\r\nthe room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly\r\nconscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to\r\nlead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said nothing. Will was\r\nfeeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his\r\nside. He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,\r\nand Dorothea drove away.\r\n\r\nIn the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some\r\nreflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her\r\npreoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that\r\nthere would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any\r\nfurther intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to\r\nmention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a\r\nmatter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her\r\nmind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she\r\nwas alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the\r\naccompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning\r\non her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder\r\nthat Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her\r\nhusband’s absence. And then she could not help remembering that he had\r\npassed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there\r\nbe any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and\r\none towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had been\r\nsigns which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr.\r\nCasaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own absence.\r\n“Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to\r\nherself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.\r\nShe felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so\r\nclear to her before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped\r\nat the gate of the Hospital. She was soon walking round the grass plots\r\nwith Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made\r\nher seek for this interview.\r\n\r\nWill Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it\r\nclearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for\r\nthe first time there had come a chance which had set him at a\r\ndisadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was\r\nnot supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under\r\ncircumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied\r\nwith her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the\r\ncircles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was\r\nnot his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,\r\nhe had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position\r\nrequiring that he should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was\r\nreally better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and\r\nhe happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling\r\nupon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had\r\ndescended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will\r\nwas conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for\r\nDorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from\r\nher with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to\r\nthe persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome\r\nand Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy\r\nin the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,\r\nlike odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and\r\nsubtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo,\r\nor as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will\r\nwas of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man\r\nof clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the\r\nfirst time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had\r\nsprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted\r\nher to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his\r\nhatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid\r\nbelow her socially. Confound Casaubon!\r\n\r\nWill re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking\r\nirritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself\r\nat her work-table, said—\r\n\r\n“It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come\r\nanother day and just finish about the rendering of ‘Lungi dal caro\r\nbene’?”\r\n\r\n“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you\r\nadmit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your\r\nacquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She looks as if\r\nshe were.”\r\n\r\n“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.\r\n\r\n“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she\r\nwere handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you\r\nare with Mrs. Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.\r\nLydgate. “When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her\r\nattributes—one is conscious of her presence.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,\r\ndimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and\r\nthink nothing of me.”\r\n\r\n“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.\r\nCasaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.”\r\n\r\n“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of\r\ntheory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just\r\nat this moment—I must really tear myself away.”\r\n\r\n“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,\r\nand I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”\r\n\r\nWhen her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of\r\nhim and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr. Ladislaw was\r\nhere singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do\r\nyou think he disliked her seeing him at our house? Surely your position\r\nis more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the\r\nCasaubons.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; it must be something else if he were really vexed. Ladislaw is\r\na sort of gypsy; he thinks nothing of leather and prunella.”\r\n\r\n“Music apart, he is not always very agreeable. Do you like him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and\r\nbric-a-brac, but likable.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n“Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s ears.\r\n\r\nRosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,\r\nespecially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood\r\nhad been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone\r\ncostumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and\r\nenslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when\r\neducated at Mrs. Lemon’s, read little French literature later than\r\nRacine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent\r\nillumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman’s\r\nwhole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight\r\nhints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite\r\nconquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage\r\nwith a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a\r\nsubject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest\r\nprobably, and if their appetite too, so much the better! But Rosamond’s\r\nromance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was\r\nenough to enjoy his assured subjection. When he said, “Poor devil!” she\r\nasked, with playful curiosity—\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?\r\nHe only neglects his work and runs up bills.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you do not neglect your work. You are always at the\r\nHospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor’s\r\nquarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope\r\nand phials. Confess you like those things better than me.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be\r\nsomething better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting his\r\nhands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with\r\naffectionate gravity. “I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an\r\nold poet—\r\n\r\n‘Why should our pride make such a stir to be\r\nAnd be forgot? What good is like to this,\r\nTo do worthy the writing, and to write\r\nWorthy the reading and the worlds delight?’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,—and to write out myself\r\nwhat I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you\r\nto attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You\r\ncannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we\r\ncannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?”\r\n\r\n“No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.”\r\n\r\n“But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Merely to ask about her husband’s health. But I think she is going to\r\nbe splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us two hundred\r\na-year.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nI would not creep along the coast but steer\r\nOut in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New\r\nHospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no signs of\r\nchange in Mr. Casaubon’s bodily condition beyond the mental sign of\r\nanxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few\r\nmoments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this\r\nnew anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of\r\nfurthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn\r\nto the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem\r\nrather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:\r\nit is because there is a fight being made against it by the other\r\nmedical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for I\r\nremember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton\r\nGrange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about\r\nthe way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable\r\nhousing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful\r\nto you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little\r\nbetter. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have\r\nbeen married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the\r\npeople in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been\r\ntoo much taken up for me to inquire further. But here—in such a place\r\nas Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.”\r\n\r\n“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.\r\n“And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.\r\nBulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money. But one man\r\ncan’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he looked\r\nforward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set up against the\r\nthing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.”\r\n\r\n“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.\r\n\r\n“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town\r\nwould almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid\r\nworld most people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless\r\nit is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before\r\nI came here. I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he has\r\nsome notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to good\r\npublic purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went to\r\nwork with the belief that their observations might contribute to the\r\nreform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change\r\nfor the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to\r\nwork with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity\r\nof making my profession more generally serviceable.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the\r\nsituation sketched in Lydgate’s words. “But what is there against Mr.\r\nBulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with him.”\r\n\r\n“People don’t like his religious tone,” said Lydgate, breaking off\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of\r\nthe great persecutions.\r\n\r\n“To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he\r\nis masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade,\r\nwhich has complaints of its own that I know nothing about. But what has\r\nthat to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing to\r\nestablish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the\r\ncounty? The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact\r\nthat Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands. Of course I\r\nam glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing some good\r\nwork,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me. But the\r\nconsequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set\r\nthemselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to\r\ncooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder\r\nsubscriptions.”\r\n\r\n“How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose one must expect to fight one’s way: there is hardly anything\r\nto be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is\r\nstupendous. I don’t lay claim to anything else than having used some\r\nopportunities which have not come within everybody’s reach; but there\r\nis no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and\r\nhappening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if I\r\nbelieve that I can set going a better method of treatment—if I believe\r\nthat I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a\r\nlasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I\r\nallowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the\r\ncourse is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put\r\nmy persistence in an equivocal light.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,” said Dorothea,\r\ncordially. “I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and\r\ndon’t know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable thought to\r\nme. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose like\r\nthis. How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure will do\r\ngreat good! I wish I could awake with that knowledge every morning.\r\nThere seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly see the\r\ngood of!”\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea’s voice as she spoke these\r\nlast words. But she presently added, more cheerfully, “Pray come to\r\nLowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject to Mr.\r\nCasaubon. I must hasten home now.”\r\n\r\nShe did mention it that evening, and said that she should like to\r\nsubscribe two hundred a-year—she had seven hundred a-year as the\r\nequivalent of her own fortune, settled on her at her marriage. Mr.\r\nCasaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might\r\nbe disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when\r\nDorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he acquiesced. He\r\ndid not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to\r\ngive it. If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through\r\nthe medium of another passion than the love of material property.\r\n\r\nDorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of\r\nher conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not\r\nquestion her further, but he felt sure that she had wished to know what\r\nhad passed between Lydgate and himself. “She knows that I know,” said\r\nthe ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge\r\nonly thrust further off any confidence between them. He distrusted her\r\naffection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nIt is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their forefathers,\r\nand declaim against the wickedness of times present. Which\r\nnotwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help\r\nand satire of times past; condemning the vices of their own times, by\r\nthe expressions of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but\r\nargue the community of vice in both. Horace, therefore, Juvenal, and\r\nPersius, were no prophets, although their lines did seem to indigitate\r\nand point at our times.—SIR THOMAS BROWNE: _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to\r\nDorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different\r\nlights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded\r\nprejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a\r\ndetermination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that\r\nvital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay\r\nrepresentative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from\r\nreligion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of\r\nhuman action. These might be called the ministerial views. But\r\noppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which\r\nneed never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw\r\nforever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch\r\nsaid about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a\r\ngreat deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody\r\nshall not be an originator; but there were differences which\r\nrepresented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.\r\nMinchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the\r\nTankard in Slaughter Lane.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,\r\nthat Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to\r\npoison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your\r\nleave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted\r\nto cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,\r\nwho had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,\r\nwho if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with\r\nyou before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you\r\nwere gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was;\r\nbut there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was\r\na bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to\r\nthe cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with\r\ntheir pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in\r\nMiddlemarch!\r\n\r\nAnd let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter\r\nLane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic\r\npublic-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was\r\nthe resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to\r\nthe vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should\r\nnot be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of\r\nperforming the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether\r\ngiven up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned\r\nagainst Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that\r\nthis power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal\r\nrecommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the\r\ncourse of the year, however, there had been a change in the public\r\nsentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop’s was an index.\r\n\r\nA good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of\r\nLydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,\r\ndepending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the\r\nstomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not\r\nthe less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients\r\nwho had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare,\r\nlike old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also,\r\nmany who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of\r\nopening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint\r\nif the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old\r\npractitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to\r\nemploy Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that\r\nhe might do more than others “where there was liver;”—at least there\r\nwould be no harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff” from him, since if\r\nthese proved useless it would still be possible to return to the\r\nPurifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the\r\nyellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch\r\nfamilies were of course not going to change their doctor without reason\r\nshown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged\r\nto accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting\r\nthat he was “not likely to be equal to Peacock.”\r\n\r\nBut Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars\r\nenough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to\r\nintensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being\r\nof that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,\r\nlike a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a\r\nnote of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly\r\nswallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created in\r\nsome Middlemarch circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it\r\nany wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who\r\nsay quarantine is no good!”\r\n\r\nOne of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense\r\ndrugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive\r\ndistinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with\r\nwhom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have\r\ncounted on having the law on their side against a man who without\r\ncalling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a\r\ncharge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee\r\nthat his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to\r\nMr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one\r\nof his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he\r\nwas injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his\r\nreasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character\r\nof practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only\r\nmode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills\r\nfor draughts, boluses, and mixtures.\r\n\r\n“It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost\r\nas mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. “To get\r\ntheir own bread they must overdose the king’s lieges; and that’s a bad\r\nsort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of\r\noutdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also\r\nasthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of\r\nview, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an\r\nexceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,\r\nand whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging\r\nkind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence\r\nfrom letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey’s\r\nfriendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of\r\nLydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness\r\nat explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the\r\nsum for reckoners sure to go wrong.\r\n\r\nLydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the\r\nstirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had\r\nknown who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning, sir,\r\ngood-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything clearly\r\nenough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he had been\r\npaying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and\r\neighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.\r\nHe had done this with satisfaction, including it among his\r\nresponsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill\r\nthan usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the\r\nmassive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the\r\npleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so\r\nas to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a\r\npractitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and\r\nespecially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had\r\nthe poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont\r\nto say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.\r\n\r\nHere were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which\r\nappeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they\r\nwere recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as\r\na fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from\r\nMr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin.\r\n\r\n“Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?”\r\nsaid Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling. “I should like\r\nhim to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn’t take\r\nstrengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think of what I have to\r\nprovide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an\r\nintimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a\r\nround of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up\r\nbest is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with\r\n_your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have\r\ntold him at once that I knew a little better than that.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my\r\nopinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he\r\ndidn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his_\r\nfinger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as well\r\nsay, ‘Mawmsey, you’re a fool.’ But I smile at it: I humor everybody’s\r\nweak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have\r\nfound it out by this time.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic\r\nwas of no use.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise. (He was\r\na stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) “How will he\r\ncure his patients, then?”\r\n\r\n“That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight\r\nto her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does _he_ suppose that people\r\nwill pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including\r\nvery full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of\r\ncourse he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare\r\ntime and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he replied,\r\nhumorously—\r\n\r\n“Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Not one that _I_ would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “_Others_ may do as\r\nthey please.”\r\n\r\nHence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer’s without fear of\r\nrivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those\r\nhypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own\r\nhonesty, and that it might be worth some people’s while to show him up.\r\nMr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the\r\nsmells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments\r\nto a balance. And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate\r\nup until he knew how. He had not indeed great resources of education,\r\nand had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional\r\ncontempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the\r\nbreathing apparatus “longs.”\r\n\r\nOther medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller shared the\r\nhighest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:\r\nthere were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of\r\nretail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he had the easiest\r\nway in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him,\r\nbeing a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was\r\nvery fond of a little sporting when he could get it, very friendly with\r\nMr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with\r\nsuch pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment,\r\nbleeding and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate\r\ndisregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the\r\nopinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed that\r\nMr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active as you\r\ncould desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his\r\nprofession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he came, he _did_\r\nsomething. He was a great favorite in his own circle, and whatever he\r\nimplied to any one’s disadvantage told doubly from his careless\r\nironical tone.\r\n\r\nHe naturally got tired of smiling and saying, “Ah!” when he was told\r\nthat Mr. Peacock’s successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and\r\nMr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.\r\nToller said, laughingly, “Dibbitts will get rid of his stale drugs,\r\nthen. I’m fond of little Dibbitts—I’m glad he’s in luck.”\r\n\r\n“I see your meaning, Toller,” said Mr. Hackbutt, “and I am entirely of\r\nyour opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that\r\neffect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the\r\ndrugs consumed by his patients. That is the rationale of the system of\r\ncharging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive\r\nthan this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.”\r\n\r\n“Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t see\r\nthat. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in.\r\nThere’s no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on\r\nthe drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by the patient,\r\nand whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,” said\r\nMr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a\r\nparty, getting the more irritable in consequence.\r\n\r\n“As to humbug, Hawley,” he said, “that’s a word easy to fling about.\r\nBut what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own\r\nnest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general\r\npractitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a gentleman. I throw back\r\nthe imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man\r\ncan be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with\r\ninnovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is\r\nmy opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who\r\ncontradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp.\r\n\r\n“I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his\r\nhands into his trouser-pockets.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking\r\nat Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we\r\nhave. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.”\r\n\r\n“Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these\r\ninfringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer\r\nhis lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it for\r\nSprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s decision.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is\r\nconcerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like\r\nit—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass the\r\nwine.”\r\n\r\nMr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,\r\nwho had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed\r\ndeclaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him\r\nin should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the\r\nmeans he might use” in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his\r\nconstant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the\r\nmore for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his\r\nmind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and\r\ncould not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a\r\nsimilar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not\r\notherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.\r\nPowderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a\r\nremarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his\r\ndesire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be\r\nlacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying\r\nPills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease\r\nat the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This\r\nco-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.\r\nPowderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it\r\nmight be attended with a blessing.\r\n\r\nBut in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by\r\nwhat we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came\r\nnewly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures\r\nwhich may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit\r\nas the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate\r\nwas attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was\r\nremarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit\r\nof bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on\r\nsuch occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave\r\nprecisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous\r\nman would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering\r\ndislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of\r\nignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the\r\ndiscernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations\r\nof ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using\r\nthose interpretations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming\r\nsymptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see\r\nher then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;\r\nwhereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of\r\ntumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,\r\ncalling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and\r\nhis wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and\r\nby this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the\r\nneighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at\r\nfirst declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in\r\nthe day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that\r\nit would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of\r\n“squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body\r\nwhen taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,”\r\nthe squitchineal by eating away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to\r\nbe one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and examining her,\r\nLydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor:\r\nit’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told\r\nher to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.\r\nLarcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was\r\nin need of good food.\r\n\r\nBut by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the\r\nsupposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only\r\nwandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife went\r\nto fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in\r\nher own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to\r\nwork again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in\r\nChurchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when\r\nLydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally\r\ndid not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken\r\nin describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a\r\nsurgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed,\r\nhowever, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had\r\nrecommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a\r\nyoungster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what\r\nhad occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general\r\npractitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner,\r\nand afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably\r\ninattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for\r\nvaluing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such\r\nrectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal\r\nqualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not\r\nclearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for\r\nbeing of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s\r\nmethod as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in\r\nthe speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and\r\nrolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and\r\nobstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.\r\n\r\nHow could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when she\r\nis expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether\r\nmistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into\r\nthe nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical\r\npropriety. Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by\r\nthat ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,\r\nLydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an\r\nevery-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he\r\nwon. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been\r\na patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his\r\nintention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject\r\nfor trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an\r\ninteresting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that\r\nthe stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with\r\nwhich he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like\r\nto be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a\r\npartner in his own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise,\r\nthat his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be\r\nleft to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with\r\nall its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the\r\nrare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational\r\nprocedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a\r\ngeneral benefit to society.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view\r\nthat an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science.\r\n\r\n“Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether\r\nignorant of the _vis medicatrix_,” said he, with his usual superiority\r\nof expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing. And he\r\nwent without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much\r\nsustained by application of the thermometer which implied the\r\nimportance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects\r\nfor the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited\r\nto the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to\r\nindulge him with a little technical talk.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a\r\ndisposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the\r\nstrength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward\r\nin awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of\r\npatient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,\r\nand liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it. He\r\nhad caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and\r\nother learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a\r\nthing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in\r\nthe secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”\r\n\r\nThis had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given\r\nto Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.\r\nThe new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of\r\nrivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical\r\ncriticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had\r\nsomething else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His\r\npractice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the\r\nreport of his high family had led to his being pretty generally\r\ninvited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the\r\nbest houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed\r\nalways to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much\r\nunanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant\r\nyoung fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to\r\nshow a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose\r\nname was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended\r\nLydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s\r\nunaccountable way of fighting on both sides.\r\n\r\nHere was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust\r\nat the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the\r\ndirection of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because\r\nthere was no present possibility of interfering with his will and\r\npleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards\r\nthe building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old\r\nInfirmary. Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be\r\nsorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of\r\nimprovement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had\r\nhad to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had\r\nundertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior\r\nfittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;\r\nand when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode\r\nmight ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,\r\nand had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had\r\nbecome an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would\r\nwillingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule\r\nit dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object\r\nwhich also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some\r\nland in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get\r\nconsiderable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile\r\nhe framed his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for\r\nfever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,\r\nthat he might have free authority to pursue all comparative\r\ninvestigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him\r\nthe importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative\r\ninfluence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and\r\nthe general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of\r\nfive directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in\r\nthe ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any\r\nvacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted\r\nto a share of government.\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the\r\ntown to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, “we have a capital\r\nhouse-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we’ll\r\nget Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,\r\nto come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,\r\nProtheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that’s all,\r\nand I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish in\r\nspite of them, and then they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last\r\nas they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young\r\nfellows may be glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n“I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr.\r\nBulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,\r\nyou shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that\r\nthe blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit\r\nof evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to\r\nassist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already\r\ngiven me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he has not\r\nspecified the sum—probably not a great one. But he will be a useful\r\nmember of the board.”\r\n\r\nA useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate\r\nnothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nThe medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.\r\nSprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s knowledge, or\r\nhis disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his\r\narrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied\r\nthat he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless\r\ninnovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the\r\ncharlatan.\r\n\r\nThe word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In\r\nthose days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.\r\nJohn Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his extraction of a fluid\r\nlike mercury from the temples of a patient.\r\n\r\nMr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that “Bulstrode\r\nhad found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure\r\nto like other sorts of charlatans.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of\r\nthirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are so many\r\nof that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make\r\npeople straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and above\r\nboard. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we call a\r\ncharlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a\r\nfellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other\r\npeople. The other day he was pretending to tap a man’s brain and get\r\nquicksilver out of it.”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s constitutions!”\r\nsaid Mrs. Taft.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played\r\neven with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much\r\nmore likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and\r\nsevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the\r\nlandlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their\r\ndead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently\r\nof a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too\r\ndaringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body, and thus gave\r\nan offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had\r\nlong resided on an income such as made this association of her body\r\nwith the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.\r\n\r\nAffairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the\r\nHospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly\r\nmisconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by\r\nhis good share of success.\r\n\r\n“They will not drive me away,” he said, talking confidentially in Mr.\r\nFarebrother’s study. “I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends\r\nI care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our\r\nwants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no\r\nseductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more\r\nconvinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous\r\norigin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,\r\nand I have been losing time.”\r\n\r\n“I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who had been\r\npuffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; “but as to the\r\nhostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are prudent.”\r\n\r\n“How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes before me\r\nto do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any more than\r\nVesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct to silly\r\nconclusions which nobody can foresee.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep\r\nyourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go\r\non doing good work of your own by his help; but don’t get tied. Perhaps\r\nit seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there’s a good deal\r\nof that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you\r\nboil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except on\r\npublic grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am not fond\r\nenough of him for that. But what was the other thing you meant?” said\r\nLydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible, and\r\nfeeling in no great need of advice.\r\n\r\n“Why, this. Take care—_experto crede_—take care not to get hampered\r\nabout money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you\r\ndon’t like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough\r\nthere. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven’t\r\ngot. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to\r\nassume superiority over himself, by holding up his bad example and\r\nsermonizing on it.”\r\n\r\nLydgate took Mr. Farebrother’s hints very cordially, though he would\r\nhardly have borne them from another man. He could not help remembering\r\nthat he had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,\r\nand he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.\r\nThe furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the\r\nstock of wine for a long while.\r\n\r\nMany thoughts cheered him at that time—and justly. A man conscious of\r\nenthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the\r\nmemory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,\r\nand who hover in his mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At home,\r\nthat same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother, he\r\nhad his long legs stretched on the sofa, his head thrown back, and his\r\nhands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude,\r\nwhile Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after another, of\r\nwhich her husband only knew (like the emotional elephant he was!) that\r\nthey fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes.\r\n\r\nThere was something very fine in Lydgate’s look just then, and any one\r\nmight have been encouraged to bet on his achievement. In his dark eyes\r\nand on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the\r\nfulness of contemplative thought—the mind not searching, but beholding,\r\nand the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.\r\n\r\nPresently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close\r\nto the sofa and opposite her husband’s face.\r\n\r\n“Is that enough music for you, my lord?” she said, folding her hands\r\nbefore her and putting on a little air of meekness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, if you are tired,” said Lydgate, gently, turning his eyes\r\nand resting them on her, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond’s presence\r\nat that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,\r\nand her woman’s instinct in this matter was not dull.\r\n\r\n“What is absorbing you?” she said, leaning forward and bringing her\r\nface nearer to his.\r\n\r\nHe moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three\r\nhundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t guess,” said Rosamond, shaking her head. “We used to play at\r\nguessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon’s, but not anatomists.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could get to\r\nknow anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from\r\ngraveyards and places of execution.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face, “I am\r\nvery glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he might find\r\nsome less horrible way than that.”\r\n\r\n“No, he couldn’t,” said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much\r\nnotice of her answer. “He could only get a complete skeleton by\r\nsnatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and\r\nburying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“I hope he is not one of your great heroes,” said Rosamond, half\r\nplayfully, half anxiously, “else I shall have you getting up in the\r\nnight to go to St. Peter’s churchyard. You know how angry you told me\r\nthe people were about Mrs. Goby. You have enemies enough already.”\r\n\r\n“So had Vesalius, Rosy. No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch are\r\njealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon\r\nVesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen\r\nwas wrong. They called him a liar and a poisonous monster. But the\r\nfacts of the human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“And what happened to him afterwards?” said Rosamond, with some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did\r\nexasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his\r\nwork. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to\r\ntake a great chair at Padua. He died rather miserably.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause before Rosamond said, “Do you know, Tertius,\r\nI often wish you had not been a medical man.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Rosy, don’t say that,” said Lydgate, drawing her closer to him.\r\n“That is like saying you wish you had married another man.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have\r\nbeen something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that you\r\nhave sunk below them in your choice of a profession.”\r\n\r\n“The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate, with\r\nscorn. “It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Rosamond, “I do _not_ think it is a nice profession,\r\ndear.” We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion.\r\n\r\n“It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said Lydgate,\r\ngravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in\r\nme, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach\r\nbut don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that again, dear, it pains me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Doctor Grave-face,” said Rosy, dimpling, “I will declare in\r\nfuture that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things\r\nin phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying\r\nmiserably.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, not so bad as that,” said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and\r\npetting her resignedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nPues no podemos haber aquello que queremos, queramos aquello que\r\npodremos.\r\n\r\nSince we cannot get what we like, let us like what we can get.—_Spanish\r\nProverb_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his command,\r\nfelt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch,\r\nMiddlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national\r\nstruggle for another kind of Reform.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Lord John Russell’s measure was being debated in the\r\nHouse of Commons, there was a new political animation in Middlemarch,\r\nand a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of\r\nbalance if a new election came. And there were some who already\r\npredicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be\r\ncarried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on\r\nto Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried\r\nhis strength at the hustings.\r\n\r\n“Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said Will.\r\n“The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question\r\nof Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before\r\nlong, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its\r\nhead. What we have to work at now is the ‘Pioneer’ and political\r\nmeetings.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,”\r\nsaid Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,\r\nyou know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take up Wilberforce’s\r\nand Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro Emancipation, Criminal\r\nLaw—that kind of thing. But of course I should support Grey.”\r\n\r\n“If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take\r\nwhat the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled for his own\r\nbit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I agree with you—I quite take that point of view. I should\r\nput it in that light. I should support Grey, you know. But I don’t want\r\nto change the balance of the constitution, and I don’t think Grey\r\nwould.”\r\n\r\n“But that is what the country wants,” said Will. “Else there would be\r\nno meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what\r\nit’s about. It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted\r\nwith nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the\r\nother interests. And as to contending for a reform short of that, it is\r\nlike asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to\r\nthunder.”\r\n\r\n“That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that down,\r\nnow. We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country,\r\nas well as the machine-breaking and general distress.”\r\n\r\n“As to documents,” said Will, “a two-inch card will hold plenty. A few\r\nrows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will\r\nshow the rate at which the political determination of the people is\r\ngrowing.”\r\n\r\n“Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw. That is an\r\nidea, now: write it out in the ‘Pioneer.’ Put the figures and deduce\r\nthe misery, you know; and put the other figures and deduce—and so on.\r\nYou have a way of putting things. Burke, now:—when I think of Burke, I\r\ncan’t help wishing somebody had a pocket-borough to give you, Ladislaw.\r\nYou’d never get elected, you know. And we shall always want talent in\r\nthe House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent. That\r\navalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke. I want\r\nthat sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”\r\n\r\n“Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they were\r\nalways in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.”\r\n\r\nWill was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from\r\nMr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be\r\nconscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have\r\nit noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right\r\nthing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather\r\nfortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond\r\nthe limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was beginning\r\nthoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to\r\nhimself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied the political\r\nsituation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic\r\nmetres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the desire to be\r\nwhere Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do,\r\nWill would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the\r\nEnglish people or criticising English statesmanship: he would probably\r\nhave been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying\r\nprose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too\r\nartificial, beginning to copy “bits” from old pictures, leaving off\r\nbecause they were “no good,” and observing that, after all,\r\nself-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have\r\nbeen sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our\r\nsense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place\r\nof dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not\r\na matter of indifference.\r\n\r\nLadislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that\r\nindeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone\r\nworthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the presence\r\nof subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the\r\neasily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. In\r\nspite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather\r\nhappy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for\r\npractical purposes, and making the “Pioneer” celebrated as far as\r\nBrassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not\r\nworse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth).\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience was\r\nrelieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and\r\nretreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.\r\n\r\n“Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke might be\r\nin the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order\r\nof things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same\r\npattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would\r\nhave trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a\r\nprecedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don’t care for prestige or\r\nhigh pay.”\r\n\r\nAs Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the\r\nsense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his\r\nposition, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise\r\nwherever he went. That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had\r\nfelt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental\r\nmeeting at Lydgate’s, and his irritation had gone out towards Mr.\r\nCasaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I\r\nnever had any caste,” he would have said, if that prophecy had been\r\nuttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone like\r\nbreath in his transparent skin. But it is one thing to like defiance,\r\nand another thing to like its consequences.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the “Pioneer” was\r\ntending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s relationship in that\r\ndistinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s high connections, serve\r\nas an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw\r\nwas Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that “Mr.\r\nCasaubon would have nothing to do with him.”\r\n\r\n“Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is what no\r\nman in his senses could have expected. Casaubon has devilish good\r\nreasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young\r\nfellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like Brooke—one of those\r\nfellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.”\r\n\r\nAnd some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to support\r\nMr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,” in asserting that Ladislaw, if\r\nthe truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,\r\nwhich accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his\r\nspeech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an\r\nopportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid\r\nEnglishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a\r\nfellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the\r\nhour against institutions “which had existed when he was in his\r\ncradle.” And in a leading article of the “Trumpet,” Keck characterized\r\nLadislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting as “the violence of an\r\nenergumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks\r\nthe daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge\r\nwhich was of the cheapest and most recent description.”\r\n\r\n“That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague, with\r\nsarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said Keck.\r\n\r\nThis dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other\r\nhabits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half artistic,\r\nhalf affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on\r\ntolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will\r\nliked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he was given to\r\nramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit him in\r\nMiddlemarch.\r\n\r\nHe had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys\r\nwith their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,\r\nlittle girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,\r\nand guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he had led\r\nout on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since the\r\ncold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather\r\nsticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a\r\nsmall feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy\r\ndrama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another\r\nwas, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to stretch\r\nhimself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be\r\ndiscovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an\r\nirregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed\r\nblood and general laxity.\r\n\r\nBut Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families\r\nwhich the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side\r\nof Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here he could not lie\r\ndown on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about\r\nCatholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,\r\nillustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had brought on\r\nthe same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a\r\nfavorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it\r\nwas one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with\r\nher little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and\r\ninsisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her\r\nsmall filchings from her own share of sweet things.\r\n\r\nBut the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was\r\nLydgate’s. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the\r\nworse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of\r\nmegrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his\r\nsusceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. With Rosamond, on\r\nthe other hand, he pouted and was wayward—nay, often uncomplimentary,\r\nmuch to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was gradually becoming\r\nnecessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music, his\r\nvaried talk, and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with\r\nall her husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners\r\nunsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nLydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the\r\npeople in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about the low\r\nstate of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.\r\nOne evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with\r\nswansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,\r\nlately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an\r\neasy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a\r\nlittle troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,”\r\nwhile Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking\r\nat him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody\r\ndisposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the\r\ncurtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of “When\r\nfirst I saw thy face;” while the house spaniel, also stretched out with\r\nsmall choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of\r\nthe rug with silent but strong objection.\r\n\r\nRosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and\r\nsaid to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—\r\n\r\n“It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:\r\nthey only pick the more holes in his coat in the ‘Trumpet.’”\r\n\r\n“No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’”\r\nsaid Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the\r\npublic reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a\r\nwitches’ brewing with a vengeance then—‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle,\r\nYou that mingle may’—and nobody would know which side he was going to\r\ntake.”\r\n\r\n“Farebrother says, he doesn’t believe Brooke would get elected if the\r\nopportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him would bring\r\nanother member out of the bag at the right moment.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident members.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word\r\nin a curt tone.\r\n\r\n“They represent the local stupidity better,” said Will, laughing, and\r\nshaking his curls; “and they are kept on their best behavior in the\r\nneighborhood. Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good\r\nthings on his estate that he never would have done but for this\r\nParliamentary bite.”\r\n\r\n“He’s not fitted to be a public man,” said Lydgate, with contemptuous\r\ndecision. “He would disappoint everybody who counted on him: I can see\r\nthat at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,” said Will.\r\n“He’s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their\r\nmind as they are making it up now, they don’t want a man—they only want\r\na vote.”\r\n\r\n“That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a\r\nmeasure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a\r\npart of the very disease that wants curing.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land\r\nwithout knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when\r\nhe had not thought of a question beforehand.\r\n\r\n“That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of\r\nhopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it\r\nwhole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to\r\ncarry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more\r\nthoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured\r\nby a political hocus-pocus.”\r\n\r\n“That’s very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere,\r\nand put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never\r\nbe reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what\r\nStanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long\r\nenough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that\r\nvoter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been\r\nsold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public\r\nagents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive\r\nsense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the\r\nwisdom of balancing claims. That’s my text—which side is injured? I\r\nsupport the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous upholder of\r\nthe wrong.”\r\n\r\n“That general talk about a particular case is mere question begging,\r\nLadislaw. When I say, I go in for the dose that cures, it doesn’t\r\nfollow that I go in for opium in a given case of gout.”\r\n\r\n“I am not begging the question we are upon—whether we are to try for\r\nnothing till we find immaculate men to work with. Should you go on that\r\nplan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and\r\nanother who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better\r\nmotives or even the better brains?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course,” said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move\r\nwhich he had often used himself, “if one did not work with such men as\r\nare at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion\r\nin the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it\r\nless true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think\r\nought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is\r\nthe only ground on which I go with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly,\r\nbearing in mind Mr. Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me\r\notherwise; I would not cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep\r\nclear of that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?” said Will\r\nLadislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time he felt\r\noffended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have\r\ndeclined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr.\r\nBrooke.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own action. I\r\nmeant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives\r\nand general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal\r\nindependence, and that he is not working for his private\r\ninterest—either place or money.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why don’t you extend your liberality to others?” said Will,\r\nstill nettled. “My personal independence is as important to me as yours\r\nis to you. You have no more reason to imagine that I have personal\r\nexpectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have personal\r\nexpectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points of honor, I\r\nsuppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the world,”\r\nWill ended, tossing back his head, “I think it is pretty clear that I\r\nam not determined by considerations of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He had been\r\npreoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what\r\nLadislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon for\r\nunintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to you\r\na romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the political\r\nquestion, I referred simply to intellectual bias.”\r\n\r\n“How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond. “I\r\ncannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Politics and\r\nMedicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can both of\r\nyou go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on those\r\ntwo topics.”\r\n\r\nRosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the\r\nbell, and then crossing to her work-table.\r\n\r\n“Poor Rosy!” said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she was\r\npassing him. “Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some music.\r\nAsk Ladislaw to sing with you.”\r\n\r\nWhen Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, “What put you out of\r\ntemper this evening, Tertius?”\r\n\r\n“Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He is like a bit of\r\ntinder.”\r\n\r\n“But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in,\r\nyou looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr. Ladislaw.\r\nYou hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.”\r\n\r\n“Do I? Then I am a brute,” said Lydgate, caressing her penitently.\r\n\r\n“What vexed you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, outdoor things—business.” It was really a letter insisting on the\r\npayment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting to have a\r\nbaby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nWas never true love loved in vain,\r\nFor truest love is highest gain.\r\nNo art can make it: it must spring\r\nWhere elements are fostering.\r\nSo in heaven’s spot and hour\r\nSprings the little native flower,\r\nDownward root and upward eye,\r\nShapen by the earth and sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that\r\nlittle discussion with Lydgate. Its effect when he went to his own\r\nrooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under\r\na new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled\r\nin Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations\r\nbefore he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to\r\nevery hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came\r\nhis heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless. Was he\r\nnot making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever\r\nconscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end?\r\n\r\nWell, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of\r\npossibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and\r\nthoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find\r\nimages rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting\r\nit with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with\r\na wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit “keeps the\r\nroadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own\r\nchoosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have\r\nthought rather idiotic. The way in which he made a sort of happiness\r\nfor himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It\r\nmay seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision\r\nof which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become\r\na widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might\r\nturn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting\r\npower over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and\r\nfollow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our\r\npractical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain\r\nthoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in\r\nthe sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of\r\ningratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between\r\nhimself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped\r\nto turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.\r\nCasaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not\r\nbear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once\r\nexasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea\r\nlooked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in\r\nthinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change\r\nwhich must somehow change her. Do we not shun the street version of a\r\nfine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of\r\nchiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with\r\nexultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is\r\nreally not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day\r\npossession? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion;\r\nand to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid\r\nthings of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within\r\nhim such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance\r\nof a fortune. What others might have called the futility of his\r\npassion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was\r\nconscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own\r\nexperience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.\r\nDorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no\r\nother woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have\r\nwritten out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he\r\nmight have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,—\r\n\r\n“Queens hereafter might be glad to live\r\nUpon the alms of her superfluous praise.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this result was questionable. And what else could he do for\r\nDorothea? What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to\r\ntell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among her\r\nfriends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple\r\nconfidence as to him. She had once said that she would like him to\r\nstay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss\r\naround her.\r\n\r\nThis had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But he was\r\nnot without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own\r\nresolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular\r\nnight, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.\r\nBrooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,\r\nand this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that\r\nnotwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could\r\nhardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these\r\nunpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I\r\nam a fool.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,\r\nhe ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of\r\nwhat her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the\r\nmorrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see\r\nher. He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational\r\nmorning light, Objection said—\r\n\r\n“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit\r\nLowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to\r\nhinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring\r\nmorning. And Dorothea will be glad.”\r\n\r\n“It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy\r\nhim or to see Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go to see\r\nDorothea? Is he to have everything to himself and be always\r\ncomfortable? Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to do.\r\nI have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;\r\nbesides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.”\r\n\r\nHaving silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick\r\nas if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and\r\nskirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding\r\nboughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green\r\ngrowths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was\r\nSunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt\r\nhappy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of\r\nvexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face\r\nbreak into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine\r\non the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are\r\napt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is\r\nodious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his\r\npersonality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book\r\nunder his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but\r\nchanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and\r\ncoming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his\r\nown, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The\r\nwords were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday\r\nexperience:—\r\n\r\n“O me, O me, what frugal cheer\r\n    My love doth feed upon!\r\nA touch, a ray, that is not here,\r\n    A shadow that is gone:\r\n\r\n“A dream of breath that might be near,\r\n    An inly-echoed tone,\r\nThe thought that one may think me dear,\r\n    The place where one was known,\r\n\r\n“The tremor of a banished fear,\r\n     An ill that was not done—\r\nO me, O me, what frugal cheer\r\n    My love doth feed upon!”\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and\r\nshowing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation\r\nof the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant\r\nin uncertain promises.\r\n\r\nThe bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick, and he went into\r\nthe curate’s pew before any one else arrived there. But he was still\r\nleft alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate’s pew\r\nwas opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and\r\nWill had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked\r\nround at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year\r\nto year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with\r\nmore change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and\r\nthere with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was\r\nsomething alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to\r\nthe order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of\r\nthe Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had\r\nthe same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent\r\ncottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters\r\ngenerally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the\r\nblack gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all\r\nbetters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at\r\npeace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the\r\nSunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church\r\nin former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who\r\nexpected him to make a figure in the singing.\r\n\r\nDorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the\r\nshort aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had\r\nworn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her entrance, towards the\r\nchancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was\r\nno outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow\r\nas she passed him. To his own surprise Will felt suddenly\r\nuncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each\r\nother. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,\r\nand, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt\r\nhis paralysis more complete. He could look nowhere except at the choir\r\nin the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps\r\npained, and he had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to\r\nvex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and\r\nseeing that he dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this\r\nbeforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square\r\npew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from\r\nLowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he called\r\nhimself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for\r\nhim to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel his coming an\r\nimpertinence. There was no delivering himself from his cage, however;\r\nand Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a\r\nschool-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so\r\nimmeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of\r\ntemper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight\r\nof a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not\r\njoin in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a cold.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in\r\nWill’s situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one\r\nrose. It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters” to go out first.\r\nWith a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will\r\nlooked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman’s eyes were on the\r\nbutton of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and\r\nfollowing her immediately without raising his eyelids. Will’s glance\r\nhad caught Dorothea’s as she turned out of the pew, and again she\r\nbowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she were\r\nrepressing tears. Will walked out after them, but they went on towards\r\nthe little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never\r\nlooking round.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk back\r\nsadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in\r\nthe morning. The lights were all changed for him both without and\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nSurely the golden hours are turning gray\r\nAnd dance no more, and vainly strive to run:\r\nI see their white locks streaming in the wind—\r\nEach face is haggard as it looks at me,\r\nSlow turning in the constant clasping round\r\nStorm-driven.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea’s distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from\r\nthe perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his\r\ncousin, and that Will’s presence at church had served to mark more\r\nstrongly the alienation between them. Will’s coming seemed to her quite\r\nexcusable, nay, she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a\r\nreconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for. He\r\nhad probably imagined, as she had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he could\r\nmeet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might\r\nreturn. But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. Will was\r\nbanished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly\r\nembittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\nHe had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty\r\nin breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not\r\nsurprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less\r\nthat he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her own part she felt\r\nthat she could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent\r\napart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon\r\nin the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she\r\nwas wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books. There was a\r\nlittle heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,\r\nfrom Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to\r\nher old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she\r\nopened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything\r\nseemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish\r\nantiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite\r\nhymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring\r\nflowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon\r\nclouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which\r\nhad become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future\r\ndays in which she would still live with them for her sole companions.\r\nIt was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor\r\nDorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual\r\neffort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what\r\nher husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she\r\nwas. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,\r\nseemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted\r\nand not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied. About\r\nWill Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,\r\nand it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed\r\nDorothea’s strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by\r\nher being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the\r\nwrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was\r\nmore wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could\r\nbe dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work\r\nwhich would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and\r\nnow it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,\r\nwhere there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would\r\nnever see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and\r\nseen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and\r\nfellowship—turning his face towards her as he went.\r\n\r\nBooks were of no use. Thinking was of no use. It was Sunday, and she\r\ncould not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.\r\nThere was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and\r\nDorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.\r\nCasaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,\r\nhe had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have revived, and to be\r\nthinking intently.\r\n\r\nIn the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of\r\nhis note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a\r\nwell-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.\r\n\r\n“You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if instead of\r\nother reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in\r\nhand, and at each point where I say ‘mark,’ will make a cross with your\r\npencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long\r\nhad in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain\r\nprinciples of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent\r\nparticipation in my purpose.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable\r\ninterview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let\r\nDorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,\r\nnamely, to demand much interest and labor from her.\r\n\r\nAfter she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will take the\r\nvolume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of reading\r\nin the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to you, I\r\ntrust, Dorothea?”\r\n\r\n“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,\r\nwho told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in\r\nreading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.\r\n\r\nIt was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in\r\nDorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his\r\njealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of\r\nher promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the\r\nright and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were\r\na peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.\r\n\r\nThe reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young weariness had\r\nslept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed\r\nto her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a\r\nsteep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm\r\ngown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the\r\nembers were still glowing. He had lit two candles, expecting that\r\nDorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.\r\n\r\n“I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a\r\ntime.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, “You\r\nwould like me to read to you?”\r\n\r\n“You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon,\r\nwith a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner. “I am\r\nwakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”\r\n\r\n“I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said Dorothea,\r\nremembering Lydgate’s cautions.\r\n\r\n“No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.” Dorothea\r\ndared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as\r\nshe had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more\r\nquickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to\r\nanticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,\r\nsaying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit\r\nthe second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the\r\nbird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it\r\nhad been creeping for years. At last he said—\r\n\r\n“Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I have\r\ndeferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you\r\nobserve that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give\r\nadequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses\r\nenumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have\r\nperceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at heart.\r\n\r\n“And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr. Casaubon. He\r\nlaid down again and begged her to put out the lights. When she had lain\r\ndown too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the\r\nhearth, he said—\r\n\r\n“Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.\r\n\r\n“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my\r\ndeath, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what\r\nI should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her\r\nto the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might\r\nmake a new yoke for her. She did not answer immediately.\r\n\r\n“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.\r\n\r\n“No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of\r\nfreedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too solemn—I think it\r\nis not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me\r\nto. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.”\r\n\r\n“But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you\r\nrefuse.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.\r\n“But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole soul\r\nto do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge\r\nsuddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”\r\n\r\n“Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.\r\n\r\n“Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\nSoon she could hear that he was sleeping, but there was no more sleep\r\nfor her. While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should\r\ndisturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination\r\nranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She had no\r\npresentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over\r\nher future action had relation to anything else than his work. But it\r\nwas clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to\r\nsifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful\r\nillustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had\r\nbecome altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key\r\nwhich had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was\r\nnot wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in\r\nthis matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed\r\ncomparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked\r\nall his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,\r\nand years which she must spend in sorting what might be called\r\nshattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a\r\nmosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory\r\nwhich was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless\r\na vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth\r\na-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of\r\nsubstances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and\r\nLavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made\r\nthe seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares\r\nagainst discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more\r\nsolid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in\r\nsound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:\r\nit was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity\r\nof forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate\r\nnotion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for\r\nthreading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check\r\nher weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as\r\nit revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge\r\nwhich was to make life worthier! She could understand well enough now\r\nwhy her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope\r\nleft that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be\r\ngiven to the world. At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even\r\nher aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually\r\nthe terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy\r\ndeath—\r\n\r\nAnd here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s\r\npast—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out\r\nof that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the\r\npressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;\r\nand now at last the sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not\r\nwished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But\r\nshe had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could\r\nserve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his\r\ngrief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a\r\ntreadmill fruitlessly?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this\r\npining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was\r\nalmost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he\r\nmight, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in\r\nhelping him and obeying him.\r\n\r\nStill, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living\r\nand that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he lived, he\r\ncould claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate\r\nagainst, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind\r\nmore than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean to\r\ndemand something more from her than she had been able to imagine, since\r\nhe wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her\r\nexactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up in his work only:\r\nthat was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to\r\nyour work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart.\r\n\r\nFor four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and\r\nbewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child\r\nwhich has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning\r\nsleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told\r\nher that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.\r\n\r\n“I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a solid-figured\r\nwoman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.\r\n\r\n“Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\n“Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose. But\r\nalways smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest a\r\nlittle this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able to go\r\ninto that close library.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, no! let me make haste,” said Dorothea. “Mr. Casaubon wants me\r\nparticularly.”\r\n\r\nWhen she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his\r\nwishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.\r\n\r\nAs Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the\r\ntable where he had been placing some books, and said—\r\n\r\n“I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set to work\r\nat once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,\r\nprobably from too much excitement yesterday. I am going now to take a\r\nturn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear that,” said Dorothea. “Your mind, I feared, was too\r\nactive last night.”\r\n\r\n“I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,\r\nDorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.”\r\n\r\n“May I come out to you in the garden presently?” said Dorothea, winning\r\na little breathing space in that way.\r\n\r\n“I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,” said Mr.\r\nCasaubon, and then he left her.\r\n\r\nDorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some\r\nwraps. She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any\r\nrenewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she was going to\r\nsay “Yes” to her own doom: she was too weak, too full of dread at the\r\nthought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her husband, to do anything\r\nbut submit completely. She sat still and let Tantripp put on her bonnet\r\nand shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her, for she liked to\r\nwait on herself.\r\n\r\n“God bless you, madam!” said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement\r\nof love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable\r\nto do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Dorothea’s highly-strung feeling, and she burst\r\ninto tears, sobbing against Tantripp’s arm. But soon she checked\r\nherself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door into the\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\n“I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your\r\nmaster,” said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in the\r\nbreakfast-room. She had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as\r\nwe know; and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but\r\n“your master,” when speaking to the other servants.\r\n\r\nPratt laughed. He liked his master very well, but he liked Tantripp\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among the\r\nnearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though\r\nfrom a different cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at\r\nfellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where\r\nshe foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she\r\nshrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only\r\nher husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the\r\nreal yoke of marriage. She saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet\r\nshe was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated\r\nhers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was\r\npassing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree\r\nWalk she could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she\r\nwent, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,\r\nwhich, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days for\r\nthe garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the\r\nsummer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the\r\nangle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.\r\nHis arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on\r\nthem, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\n“He exhausted himself last night,” Dorothea said to herself, thinking\r\nat first that he was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a\r\nplace to rest in. But then she remembered that of late she had seen him\r\ntake that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it\r\neasier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as\r\nlisten, with his face down in that way. She went into the summerhouse\r\nand said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”\r\n\r\nHe took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She\r\nlaid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was\r\nmotionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,\r\ntook off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying\r\nin a distressed tone—\r\n\r\n“Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.” But Dorothea\r\nnever gave her answer.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was\r\ntalking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone\r\nthrough her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by his\r\nname, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything\r\nto him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise. Only, thinking\r\nabout it was so dreadful—it has made me ill. Not very ill. I shall soon\r\nbe better. Go and tell him.”\r\n\r\nBut the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n“A task too strong for wizard spells\r\nThis squire had brought about;\r\n’T is easy dropping stones in wells,\r\nBut who shall get them out?”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,” said Sir\r\nJames Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an expression of\r\nintense disgust about his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and\r\nspeaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been\r\nburied, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room.\r\n\r\n“That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an executrix,\r\nand she likes to go into these things—property, land, that kind of\r\nthing. She has her notions, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, sticking his\r\neye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper\r\nwhich he held in his hand; “and she would like to act—depend upon it,\r\nas an executrix Dorothea would want to act. And she was twenty-one last\r\nDecember, you know. I can hinder nothing.”\r\n\r\nSir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then\r\nlifting his eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke, saying, “I will\r\ntell you what we can do. Until Dorothea is well, all business must be\r\nkept from her, and as soon as she is able to be moved she must come to\r\nus. Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world\r\nfor her, and will pass away the time. And meanwhile you must get rid of\r\nLadislaw: you must send him out of the country.” Here Sir James’s look\r\nof disgust returned in all its intensity.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke put his hands behind him, walked to the window and\r\nstraightened his back with a little shake before he replied.\r\n\r\n“That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation within\r\nrespectful forms, “it was you who brought him here, and you who keep\r\nhim here—I mean by the occupation you give him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I can’t dismiss him in an instant without assigning reasons,\r\nmy dear Chettam. Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory. I\r\nconsider that I have done this part of the country a service by\r\nbringing him—by bringing him, you know.” Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,\r\nturning round to give it.\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity this part of the country didn’t do without him, that’s all\r\nI have to say about it. At any rate, as Dorothea’s brother-in-law, I\r\nfeel warranted in objecting strongly to his being kept here by any\r\naction on the part of her friends. You admit, I hope, that I have a\r\nright to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife’s sister?”\r\n\r\nSir James was getting warm.\r\n\r\n“Of course, my dear Chettam, of course. But you and I have different\r\nideas—different—”\r\n\r\n“Not about this action of Casaubon’s, I should hope,” interrupted Sir\r\nJames. “I say that he has most unfairly compromised Dorothea. I say\r\nthat there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this—a\r\ncodicil of this sort to a will which he made at the time of his\r\nmarriage with the knowledge and reliance of her family—a positive\r\ninsult to Dorothea!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw. Ladislaw\r\nhas told me the reason—dislike of the bent he took, you know—Ladislaw\r\ndidn’t think much of Casaubon’s notions, Thoth and Dagon—that sort of\r\nthing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn’t like the independent position\r\nLadislaw had taken up. I saw the letters between them, you know. Poor\r\nCasaubon was a little buried in books—he didn’t know the world.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it,” said Sir\r\nJames. “But I believe Casaubon was only jealous of him on Dorothea’s\r\naccount, and the world will suppose that she gave him some reason; and\r\nthat is what makes it so abominable—coupling her name with this young\r\nfellow’s.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Chettam, it won’t lead to anything, you know,” said Mr.\r\nBrooke, seating himself and sticking on his eye-glass again. “It’s all\r\nof a piece with Casaubon’s oddity. This paper, now, ‘Synoptical\r\nTabulation’ and so on, ‘for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,’ it was locked up\r\nin the desk with the will. I suppose he meant Dorothea to publish his\r\nresearches, eh? and she’ll do it, you know; she has gone into his\r\nstudies uncommonly.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” said Sir James, impatiently, “that is neither here nor\r\nthere. The question is, whether you don’t see with me the propriety of\r\nsending young Ladislaw away?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it may\r\ncome round. As to gossip, you know, sending him away won’t hinder\r\ngossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter\r\nand verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that\r\nlay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a\r\ncertain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from him, and that sort of thing;\r\nbut I couldn’t send him out of the country if he didn’t choose to\r\ngo—didn’t choose, you know.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the\r\nnature of last year’s weather, and nodding at the end with his usual\r\namenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever showed,\r\n“let us get him a post; let us spend money on him. If he could go in\r\nthe suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take him—and I could\r\nwrite to Fulke about it.”\r\n\r\n“But Ladislaw won’t be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear\r\nfellow; Ladislaw has his ideas. It’s my opinion that if he were to part\r\nfrom me to-morrow, you’d only hear the more of him in the country. With\r\nhis talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few men who\r\ncould come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Agitator!” said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the\r\nsyllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of\r\nits hatefulness.\r\n\r\n“But be reasonable, Chettam. Dorothea, now. As you say, she had better\r\ngo to Celia as soon as possible. She can stay under your roof, and in\r\nthe mean time things may come round quietly. Don’t let us be firing off\r\nour guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep our counsel, and the\r\nnews will be old before it’s known. Twenty things may happen to carry\r\noff Ladislaw—without my doing anything, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?”\r\n\r\n“Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn’t say decline. But I really don’t see what\r\nI could do. Ladislaw is a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it!” said Sir James, his irritation making him\r\nforget himself a little. “I am sure Casaubon was not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder\r\nher from marrying again at all, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that,” said Sir James. “It would have been less\r\nindelicate.”\r\n\r\n“One of poor Casaubon’s freaks! That attack upset his brain a little.\r\nIt all goes for nothing. She doesn’t _want_ to marry Ladislaw.”\r\n\r\n“But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she\r\ndid. I don’t believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,” said Sir\r\nJames—then frowningly, “but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you frankly, I\r\nsuspect Ladislaw.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam. In fact,\r\nif it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk Island—that\r\nsort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea to those who\r\nknew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted her—distrusted her,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to\r\nsoothe Sir James. He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying that\r\nhe did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat—\r\n\r\n“Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,\r\nbecause her friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as her\r\nbrother, to protect her now.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t do better than get her to Freshitt as soon as possible,\r\nChettam. I approve that plan altogether,” said Mr. Brooke, well pleased\r\nthat he had won the argument. It would have been highly inconvenient to\r\nhim to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a dissolution might happen\r\nany day, and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the\r\ninterests of the country would be best served. Mr. Brooke sincerely\r\nbelieved that this end could be secured by his own return to\r\nParliament: he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n“This Loller here wol precilen us somewhat.”\r\n“Nay by my father’s soule! that schal he nat,”\r\nSayde the Schipman, ‘here schal he not preche,\r\nWe schal no gospel glosen here ne teche.\r\nWe leven all in the gret God,’ quod he.\r\nHe wolden sowen some diffcultee.”—_Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had\r\nasked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she sat with Celia in\r\nthe prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small\r\nconservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed\r\nviolets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so\r\ndubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted\r\nby appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.\r\nDorothea sat by in her widow’s dress, with an expression which rather\r\nprovoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite\r\nwell, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while\r\nhe lived, and besides that had—well, well! Sir James, of course, had\r\ntold Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it\r\nwas that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not\r\nlong remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the\r\npurport of her husband’s will made at the time of their marriage, and\r\nher mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was\r\nsilently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick\r\nManor with the patronage of the living attached to it.\r\n\r\nOne morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an unusual\r\nalacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now\r\npretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said—\r\n\r\n“Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have the\r\nliving at Lowick. After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never heard\r\nmy husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as a successor to\r\nhimself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to Lowick to\r\nexamine all my husband’s papers. There may be something that would\r\nthrow light on his wishes.”\r\n\r\n“No hurry, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, quietly. “By-and-by, you know,\r\nyou can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks\r\nand drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects, you\r\nknow—besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the\r\nliving, I have had an application for interest already—I should say\r\nrather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had\r\nsomething to do with getting him an appointment before. An apostolic\r\nman, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for\r\nmyself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his wishes. He\r\nhas perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some\r\ninstructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while had this\r\nconjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s work.\r\n\r\n“Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke, rising\r\nto go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor about his\r\nresearches, you know. Nothing in the will.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s lip quivered.\r\n\r\n“Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end of\r\nwork now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia\r\nand her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of\r\ngrandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away\r\nand tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if\r\nDorothea insisted on looking into everything.\r\n\r\nDorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and\r\ncast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.\r\n\r\n“Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?” said\r\nCelia, in her comfortable staccato.\r\n\r\n“What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently.\r\n\r\n“What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if he\r\nmeant to make a face. Isn’t it wonderful! He may have his little\r\nthoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at him.”\r\n\r\nA large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down\r\nDorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am\r\nsure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over\r\neverything—to see if there were any words written for me.”\r\n\r\n“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not\r\nsaid so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the\r\ngallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,\r\nDodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”\r\n\r\n“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost\r\nready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering\r\nwith some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and\r\nwas determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or\r\nknew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new\r\nsense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that\r\nwhere there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in\r\ngeneral, was a mere lack of that central poising force.\r\n\r\n“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said\r\nCelia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable\r\nfor you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had\r\nnot been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and\r\nyou will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry\r\nwith him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”\r\n\r\n“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once\r\nwhat you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left\r\nthe property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.\r\n\r\n“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to\r\ngo away from you if you married—I mean—”\r\n\r\n“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.\r\n\r\n“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with\r\npersevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence in one\r\nway—you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse\r\nof Mr. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But Celia was\r\nadministering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking\r\nup notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in\r\nher neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.\r\n\r\n“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And\r\nthere never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon\r\nwanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.\r\nLadislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.\r\nLadislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever\r\nwould think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as\r\nwell marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at\r\nbaby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light\r\nshawl over her, and tripping away.\r\n\r\nDorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back\r\nhelplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that\r\nmoment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on\r\na new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory\r\nwould not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was\r\nchanging its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling\r\ntowards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole\r\nrelation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive\r\nchange; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that\r\nshe must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\r\nbeen a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed\r\nhusband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she\r\nsaid and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also\r\nmade her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards\r\nWill Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,\r\nunder any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the\r\nsudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that\r\nperhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this\r\nwith the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and\r\nquestions not soon to be solved.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia\r\nsaying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can\r\ngo to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,\r\nDodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was\r\nleaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.\r\nCasaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I\r\nthink the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has\r\nbehaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make\r\nyourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\r\nmercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,\r\nbaby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise\r\nof the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to\r\nthe nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to\r\nmake—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he\r\nsaid was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have\r\nyou been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of\r\na marble coldness.\r\n\r\n“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She\r\nought not, ought she?”\r\n\r\nLydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at\r\nDorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what\r\nwould give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always\r\ncome from being forbidden to act.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise.\r\nThere are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit\r\nhere idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with\r\nher agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,\r\nI think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have\r\nserious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.\r\nTyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she\r\nbroke off and burst into sobs.\r\n\r\nLydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.\r\n\r\n“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he\r\nasked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I\r\nthink, more than any other prescription.”\r\n\r\nHis attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him\r\nto form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He\r\nfelt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of\r\nself-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in\r\nanother sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.\r\n\r\nLydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he\r\nfound that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about\r\nthe will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay\r\nin the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James\r\ncomplied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.\r\n\r\n“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could\r\nhardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be\r\nable to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at\r\nit from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little\r\nwhile with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the\r\npeople in the village.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are\r\nbetter out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that\r\nmoment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s.\r\nBut no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable\r\npart of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it\r\nbetween them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,\r\nabout disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have\r\nchosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to\r\nher at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her\r\nhusband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what\r\nhad passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral\r\nclaim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him\r\nas it was to her, that her husband’s strange indelicate proviso had\r\nbeen chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and\r\nnot merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it\r\nmust be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s\r\nsake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of\r\nMr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian\r\ncarrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like\r\na mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.\r\n\r\nAt Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s\r\nplaces of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed\r\nespecially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was\r\nprobably only the beginning of many intended directions for her\r\nguidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all\r\nelse, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan\r\nof transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense\r\nof moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s\r\ncompetence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust\r\nof any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for\r\nhimself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:\r\nand he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to\r\nerect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the\r\nfuture volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But\r\nthe months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had\r\ntime to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp\r\non Dorothea’s life.\r\n\r\nThe grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of\r\nher pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her\r\njudgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of\r\nfaithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of\r\nbeing controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the\r\nimbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the\r\nhidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man\r\nwas no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the\r\nretrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been\r\nlower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had\r\neven blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him\r\ndefeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the\r\nproperty which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been\r\nglad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune\r\nwhich had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to\r\nownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many\r\ntroublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\r\nthinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it\r\nnot impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had\r\ntaken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation\r\nagainst him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of\r\nhis purpose revolted her.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she\r\nlocked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for\r\nher—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart\r\nhad gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to\r\nFreshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last\r\ninjurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.\r\n\r\nDorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and\r\none of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her\r\nof. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as\r\nsoon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of\r\nmaking amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an\r\nill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.\r\nTyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,\r\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a\r\nstinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and\r\nsister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\r\nmarried because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such\r\nplain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross\r\nafter old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:\r\noriginal, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to\r\nhave done more than he has done.”\r\n\r\n“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who\r\nhad slipped below their own intention.\r\n\r\n“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s\r\nuncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many\r\nstrings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into\r\nthe wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor\r\nclergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very\r\nfond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is\r\nhampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money\r\nto spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into\r\ncard-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\r\nmoney, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a\r\nlittle beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,\r\nwith all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most\r\nblameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,\r\nand those often go with a more correct outside.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”\r\nsaid Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into\r\nplenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said\r\nDorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the\r\ntimes of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a\r\nstrong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.\r\n\r\n“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.\r\n“His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a\r\nparson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.\r\nPractically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an\r\nimpatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal\r\nfigure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good\r\ndeal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people\r\nuncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\r\nought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the\r\nbirds.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our\r\nfarmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into\r\na volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at\r\nLowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the\r\nApocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which\r\nChristianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a\r\nwider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean\r\nthat which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most\r\npeople as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than\r\nto condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear\r\nhim preach.”\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Lydgate; “I trust to the effect of that. He is very much\r\nbeloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t\r\nforgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning\r\nbusiness is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see many Middlemarch\r\npeople: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a\r\ngreat friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and would be glad to sing\r\nthe Vicar’s praises. One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a\r\nwonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw\r\ngallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you\r\nknow Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this\r\nlittle old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple\r\ndropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about\r\nFarebrother is to see him and hear him.”\r\n\r\nHappily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation\r\noccurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate’s innocent\r\nintroduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in\r\nmatters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s\r\nremark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he\r\nwas only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he\r\nhad purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the\r\nVicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor\r\nto warn him that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous\r\nsubject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw\r\nlingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the\r\nLowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear\r\nof that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And\r\nhow would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as\r\npossible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with\r\nwhite mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every\r\none’s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of\r\nurging his own with iron resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nParty is Nature too, and you shall see\r\nBy force of Logic how they both agree:\r\nThe Many in the One, the One in Many;\r\nAll is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:\r\nGenus holds species, both are great or small;\r\nOne genus highest, one not high at all;\r\nEach species has its differentia too,\r\nThis is not That, and He was never You,\r\nThough this and that are AYES, and you and he\r\nAre like as one to one, or three to three.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo gossip about Mr. Casaubon’s will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air\r\nseemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming\r\nelection, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter\r\nof itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice\r\nof. The famous “dry election” was at hand, in which the depths of\r\npublic feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will\r\nLadislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea’s\r\nwidowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to\r\nbe spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell\r\nhim what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather\r\nwaspishly—\r\n\r\n“Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,\r\nand am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I never go\r\nthere. It is Tory ground, where I and the ‘Pioneer’ are no more welcome\r\nthan a poacher and his gun.”\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing\r\nthat Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the\r\nGrange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to\r\ncontrive that he should go there as little as possible. This was a\r\nshuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir James Chettam’s indignant\r\nremonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,\r\nconcluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea’s\r\naccount. Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion? Their\r\nfears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they\r\nimagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying\r\nto win the favor of a rich woman.\r\n\r\nUntil now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and\r\nDorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on\r\nthe other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of\r\ngoing away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to\r\nshow any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to\r\ndisagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might\r\ntry to poison.\r\n\r\n“We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at Rome; she\r\nwould be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often\r\nonly the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons\r\nwhy he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at\r\nthis crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed “coaching”\r\nfor the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and\r\nindirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own\r\nchessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,\r\neven if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a\r\ngentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke\r\nand keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote\r\nfor the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence\r\nand power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr.\r\nFarebrother’s prophecy of a fourth candidate “in the bag” had not yet\r\nbeen fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any\r\nother power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy\r\nnodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate\r\nlike Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the\r\nfight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the\r\nnew Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future\r\nindependent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.\r\nMr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of\r\nPinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers\r\nwhich would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory\r\nvotes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nThis prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.\r\nBrooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by\r\nwavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh\r\nat opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will\r\nLadislaw much trouble.\r\n\r\n“You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke; “meeting\r\npeople half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ‘Well now, there’s\r\nsomething in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar\r\noccasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort\r\nof thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.\r\nThese ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line\r\nsomewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a difficult question, now,\r\nif you go into it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to wait till\r\nwe get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a\r\nrevolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As\r\nfor trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared\r\nto him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval\r\nthe wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn\r\ninto using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was\r\nin excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of\r\nmoney; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been\r\ntested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing\r\nother orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he\r\ncame away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it\r\nwas a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a\r\nlittle conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief\r\nrepresentative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail\r\ntrader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the\r\nborough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and\r\nsugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially\r\nwith both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of\r\nelecting members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were\r\nno danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would\r\nbe the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people\r\nwhose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large\r\norders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of\r\nPinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on\r\ntheir side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in\r\nhis intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a\r\nhostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back\r\nparlor.\r\n\r\n“As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling the\r\nsmall silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it support Mrs.\r\nMawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I\r\nput the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very\r\nwell, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when\r\ngentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote\r\nagainst us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor\r\nI like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining\r\ntradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,\r\nsir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your\r\nhonorable self, Mr. Brooke.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of\r\nyour goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear\r\nthat you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order\r\nhim to go elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,\r\nfeeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some\r\npleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put\r\nyourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a\r\nthoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come\r\nfirst before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve\r\ngot to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.\r\nWe’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a\r\nvote, now: why, it may help to make men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s\r\nno knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a\r\nsense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.\r\nBut Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I\r\nmust know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on\r\nmy till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what\r\nnobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought\r\nin currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself\r\nseen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But\r\nas to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not\r\ngoing to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as\r\nthey are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,\r\npersonally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those\r\nwho have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish\r\nand private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and\r\ncustom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from\r\nme, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife\r\nthat he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he\r\ndidn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to\r\nLadislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he\r\nhad no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative\r\nsort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,\r\nnecessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the\r\nMiddlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side\r\nof the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it\r\non the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally\r\nParliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,\r\ncould hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.\r\nThere were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty\r\nbusiness; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.\r\nBrooke through would be quite innocent.\r\n\r\nBut whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the\r\nmajority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out\r\nvarious speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to\r\nperceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering\r\nany train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and\r\nnot easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving\r\nyour country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.\r\nNo! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of\r\nthe right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them\r\ntill they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the\r\ndifficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in\r\nbeforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in\r\nhis way when he was speaking.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for\r\nbefore the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the\r\nworthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,\r\nwhich looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,\r\ncommanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a\r\nfine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some\r\nprospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,\r\nto which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such\r\nmanufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which\r\nalmost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for\r\nPinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened\r\nthe blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord\r\nin the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove\r\ninto the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored\r\nwaistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that\r\nall moments seem comfortably remote until the last.\r\n\r\n“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall\r\nhave a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public\r\nmade up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never\r\nthought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him\r\nthan if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened\r\nwithout much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,\r\none of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell\r\nMiddlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what\r\nthe candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became\r\ndenser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,\r\nMr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still\r\nhandled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged\r\nremarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy\r\nair, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the\r\nsupposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious\r\nman, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval\r\nfrom the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his\r\nenergies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English\r\ngentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private\r\ngrounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for\r\nParliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but\r\nbeing once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying.\r\n\r\nIt was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all\r\nanxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it\r\nquite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking\r\nwould be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was\r\nalarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his\r\nstomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he\r\ncontinued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite\r\nloud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other\r\nexpressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish\r\n(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks\r\ndangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,\r\nthe cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable\r\nthan Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left\r\nhand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his\r\neye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff\r\nwaistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began\r\nwith some confidence.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”\r\n\r\nThis was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my\r\nlife—never so happy, you know.”\r\n\r\nThis was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,\r\nunhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may\r\nbe but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when fear clutches us, and a\r\nglass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who\r\nstood at the window behind the speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The\r\nonly chance is that, since the best thing won’t always do, floundering\r\nmay answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,\r\nfell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate\r\ngraceful subject for a candidate.\r\n\r\n“I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you’ve known me on the\r\nbench a good while—I’ve always gone a good deal into public\r\nquestions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you\r\nconcerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It\r\nwon’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,\r\nmanufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since\r\nAdam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the\r\nglobe:—‘Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere, ‘from\r\nChina to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ‘The Rambler,’ you\r\nknow. That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as\r\nPeru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn’t do. I’ve\r\nbeen in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,\r\nagain, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.”\r\n\r\nPlying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got\r\nalong, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest\r\nseas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the\r\nenemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders\r\nof the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,\r\nthe effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral\r\nphysiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the\r\nair, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of\r\nhis words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the\r\nopposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,\r\nor filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish\r\nmockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this\r\necho was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision\r\nof a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By\r\nthe time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running\r\nthrough the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering\r\neffects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of\r\nthings had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have\r\ncaught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new\r\npolice was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack\r\non the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since\r\nHawley probably meant it to be pelted.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of\r\nanything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had\r\neven a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had\r\nnot yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of\r\nhimself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than\r\nanxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;\r\nbut he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at\r\nthis moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that\r\nhis lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,\r\nwith an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want\r\na precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say\r\nI should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a\r\nman of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice from the\r\ncrowd below.\r\n\r\nImmediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,\r\nrepeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder\r\nthan ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,\r\nheard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his\r\ninterrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with\r\namenity—\r\n\r\n“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we\r\nmeet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the\r\npress, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have the\r\nBill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take\r\nthe paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and\r\ncoming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—\r\n\r\n“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a\r\nseat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven\r\nshillings, and fourpence.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass\r\nfall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which\r\nhad come nearer. The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with\r\neggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too.\r\n\r\n“Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very\r\nwell”—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the\r\necho said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs, chiefly\r\naimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by\r\nchance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;\r\nwhistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub\r\nbecause there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice\r\nwould have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,\r\ndisagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration\r\nwould have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and\r\nboyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter “can aver\r\nthat it endangered the learned gentleman’s ribs,” or can respectfully\r\nbear witness to “the soles of that gentleman’s boots having been\r\nvisible above the railing,” has perhaps more consolations attached to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he\r\ncould, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear\r\nof the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I should have\r\ngone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,” he added, glancing at\r\nLadislaw. “However, things will come all right at the nomination.”\r\n\r\nBut it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on\r\nthe contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political\r\npersonage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\n“It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I know it as\r\nwell as if he had been advertised. He’s uncommonly good at\r\nventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has been\r\nhaving him to dinner lately: there’s a fund of talent in Bowyer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would\r\nhave invited him to dine,” said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a\r\ngreat deal of inviting for the good of his country.\r\n\r\n“There’s not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,” said\r\nLadislaw, indignantly, “but it seems as if the paltry fellows were\r\nalways to turn the scale.”\r\n\r\nWill was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his\r\n“principal,” and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a\r\nhalf-formed resolve to throw up the “Pioneer” and Mr. Brooke together.\r\nWhy should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea\r\nwere ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and\r\ngetting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and\r\nslipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then\r\ncame the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for\r\nexample: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher\r\nvalue now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they\r\nmight give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking\r\nDorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that\r\nshe cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware\r\nthat he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering\r\nhimself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at\r\nfive-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,\r\nwhere talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.\r\nHe could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he\r\nchose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on\r\nwhich he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted\r\nabove the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that\r\neminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,\r\nand make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”\r\n\r\nBut not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him\r\nand Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he\r\nwere the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence\r\nhe must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.\r\n\r\nBut he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him\r\nin the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and\r\nvoices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a\r\nstronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to\r\nwithdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages\r\nof his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,\r\nbut observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement\r\nthan he had imagined.\r\n\r\n“I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that too far,”\r\nhe said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must pull up. Poor\r\nCasaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some heavy advances, but\r\nI’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse work—this electioneering, eh,\r\nLadislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel\r\nwith the ‘Pioneer’—put things in a track, and so on. A more ordinary\r\nman than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color coming in\r\nhis face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three\r\nsteps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to do so whenever you\r\nwish it.”\r\n\r\n“As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your\r\npowers, you know. But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a\r\nlittle with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take\r\nit into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in\r\nfact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might find\r\na better field. These people might not take that high view of you which\r\nI have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I always\r\nlooked forward to your doing something else. I think of having a run\r\ninto France. But I’ll write you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and\r\npeople of that kind. I’ve met Althorpe.”\r\n\r\n“I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly. “Since you\r\nare going to part with the ‘Pioneer,’ I need not trouble you about the\r\nsteps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.”\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of the\r\nfamily have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t care now\r\nabout my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own\r\nmovements and not because they are afraid of me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n“His heart\r\nThe lowliest duties on itself did lay.”\r\n—WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the\r\nLowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the\r\nportraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. His\r\nmother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual pretty\r\nprimness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and\r\nbrightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary\r\nidentity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—\r\n\r\n“The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.”\r\n\r\n“When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come\r\nafter,” said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal\r\nit. The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to\r\nhave energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy\r\nvision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his\r\nglances.\r\n\r\n“Now, aunt,” he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,\r\nwho was making tender little beaver-like noises, “There shall be\r\nsugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the\r\nchildren, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make\r\npresents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!”\r\n\r\nMiss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,\r\nconscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into\r\nher basket on the strength of the new preferment.\r\n\r\n“As for you, Winny”—the Vicar went on—“I shall make no difficulty about\r\nyour marrying any Lowick bachelor—Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for\r\nexample, as soon as I find you are in love with him.”\r\n\r\nMiss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and\r\ncrying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her\r\ntears and said, “You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart. But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old\r\nfellow,” said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking\r\ndown at himself. “What do you say, mother?”\r\n\r\n“You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man\r\nas your father,” said the old lady.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred. “She\r\nwould make us so lively at Lowick.”\r\n\r\n“Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like\r\npoultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have\r\nme,” said the Vicar, not caring to specify.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred. “But _you_ would like\r\nMiss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic\r\ndiscretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want\r\nyour whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was\r\na whist-player.” (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by\r\nthat magnificent name.)\r\n\r\n“I shall do without whist now, mother.”\r\n\r\n“Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement\r\nfor a good churchman,” said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning\r\nthat whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some\r\ndangerous countenancing of new doctrine.\r\n\r\n“I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,” said the\r\nVicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.\r\n\r\nHe had already said to Dorothea, “I don’t feel bound to give up St.\r\nBotolph’s. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to\r\nreform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is\r\nnot to give up power, but to use it well.”\r\n\r\n“I have thought of that,” said Dorothea. “So far as self is concerned,\r\nI think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep\r\nthem. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I\r\nfelt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,”\r\nsaid Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\nHis was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active\r\nwhen the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He made no display of\r\nhumility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that\r\nhis conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices\r\nwere free from.\r\n\r\n“I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,” he\r\nsaid to Lydgate, “but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good\r\na clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of\r\nview, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,” he\r\nended, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. But\r\nDuty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy friend\r\nwhom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg within\r\nour gates.\r\n\r\nHardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the\r\ndisguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his\r\nbachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\n“I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, whose fair\r\nopen face was propitiating, “but you are the only friend I can consult.\r\nI told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can’t\r\nhelp coming to you again.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Fred, I’m ready to hear and do anything I can,” said the\r\nVicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on\r\nwith his work.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to tell you—” Fred hesitated an instant and then went on\r\nplungingly, “I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I\r\nmay, I can’t see anything else to do. I don’t like it, but I know it’s\r\nuncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal\r\nof money in educating me for it.” Fred paused again an instant, and\r\nthen repeated, “and I can’t see anything else to do.”\r\n\r\n“I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with\r\nhim. He said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now:\r\nwhat are your other difficulties?”\r\n\r\n“Merely that I don’t like it. I don’t like divinity, and preaching, and\r\nfeeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and\r\ndoing as other men do. I don’t mean that I want to be a bad fellow in\r\nany way; but I’ve no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a\r\nclergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can’t spare me any\r\ncapital, else I might go into farming. And he has no room for me in his\r\ntrade. And of course I can’t begin to study for law or physic now, when\r\nmy father wants me to earn something. It’s all very well to say I’m\r\nwrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me\r\nto go into the backwoods.”\r\n\r\nFred’s voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.\r\nFarebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been\r\ntoo busy in imagining more than Fred told him.\r\n\r\n“Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?” he\r\nsaid, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred’s sake.\r\n\r\n“No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any\r\narguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am\r\ngo in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to\r\nurge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,” said Fred, quite\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair\r\nparish priest without being much of a divine?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my\r\nduty, though I mayn’t like it. Do you think any body ought to blame\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on\r\nyour conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what\r\nyour position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,\r\nthat I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.”\r\n\r\n“But there is another hindrance,” said Fred, coloring. “I did not tell\r\nyou before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess\r\nit. There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we\r\nwere children.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I shouldn’t mind anything if she would have me. And I know I\r\ncould be a good fellow then.”\r\n\r\n“And you think she returns the feeling?”\r\n\r\n“She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to\r\nspeak to her about it again. And she has set her mind especially\r\nagainst my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can’t give her up. I\r\ndo think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said\r\nthat Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?”\r\n\r\n“No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in\r\nthis way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the\r\nsubject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.”\r\n\r\n“That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to\r\npresuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you\r\nwish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I want her to tell you,” said Fred, bluntly. “I don’t\r\nknow what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the\r\nChurch?”\r\n\r\n“If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one\r\nway as another.”\r\n\r\n“That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive\r\nthe consequences of their recklessness.”\r\n\r\n“Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had\r\nto give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.”\r\n\r\n“Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?”\r\n\r\n“No, I feel sure she will not. She respects you more than any one, and\r\nshe would not put you off with fun as she does me. Of course I could\r\nnot have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her, but\r\nyou. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.”\r\nFred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, “And she\r\nought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She ought to\r\nbelieve that I would exert myself for her sake.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,\r\nand putting out his hand to Fred said—\r\n\r\n“Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.”\r\n\r\nThat very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which\r\nhe had just set up. “Decidedly I am an old stalk,” he thought, “the\r\nyoung growths are pushing me aside.”\r\n\r\nHe found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals\r\non a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across\r\nthe grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She\r\ndid not observe Mr. Farebrother’s approach along the grass, and had\r\njust stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would\r\npersist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary\r\nsprinkled them. She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the\r\nforefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked\r\nembarrassed. “Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,” Mary was saying in a\r\ngrave contralto. “This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would\r\nthink you were a silly young gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,” said the Vicar,\r\nwithin two yards of her.\r\n\r\nMary started up and blushed. “It always answers to reason with Fly,”\r\nshe said, laughingly.\r\n\r\n“But not with young gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to\r\ninterest you in a young gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses\r\nagain, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather\r\naffection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two\r\nqualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those\r\nmarks what young gentleman I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I do,” said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,\r\nand her hands cold; “it must be Fred Vincy.”\r\n\r\n“He has asked me to consult you about his going into the Church. I hope\r\nyou will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising to\r\ndo so.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, giving up the roses, and\r\nfolding her arms, but unable to look up, “whenever you have anything to\r\nsay to me I feel honored.”\r\n\r\n“But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on\r\nwhich your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very\r\nevening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just\r\nafter he had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the\r\nnight of Featherstone’s death—how you refused to burn the will; and he\r\nsaid that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had\r\nbeen the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand\r\npounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may\r\nrelieve you on that score—may show you that no sin-offering is demanded\r\nfrom you there.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He meant to give\r\nFred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her\r\nmind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do\r\na man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement. Mary’s cheeks\r\nhad begun to burn a little, and she was mute.\r\n\r\n“I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred’s lot. I find\r\nthat the first will would not have been legally good after the burning\r\nof the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you\r\nmay be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may\r\nfeel your mind free.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, earnestly. “I am grateful to\r\nyou for remembering my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his degree. He has\r\nworked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do? That\r\nquestion is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s\r\nwishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he\r\nwas quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the\r\nsubject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a\r\nclergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing\r\nhis best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were\r\nfulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of\r\ncourse, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so\r\nmuch to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as\r\nvicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this\r\ngood cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,\r\nand asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your\r\nfeeling.”\r\n\r\nMary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, “Let us walk a\r\nlittle;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,\r\nFred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you\r\nwould consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his\r\nbest at anything you approve.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:\r\nbut I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What\r\nyou say is most generous and kind; I don’t mean for a moment to correct\r\nyour judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of\r\nlooking at things,” said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness\r\nin her answer which only made its modesty more charming.\r\n\r\n“He wishes me to report exactly what you think,” said Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to\r\ngo deeper. “Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him\r\nrespectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can\r\nnever imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,\r\nand praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a\r\ncaricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,\r\nand I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile\r\ngentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\r\nneat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to\r\nrepresent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up\r\nidiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried\r\nalong as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men\r\ndo, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you\r\ndon’t put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it\r\nas a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”\r\n\r\n“Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he could have no\r\nhope?”\r\n\r\nMary shook her head.\r\n\r\n“But if he braved all the difficulties of getting his bread in some\r\nother way—will you give him the support of hope? May he count on\r\nwinning you?”\r\n\r\n“I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said\r\nto him,” Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner. “I mean\r\nthat he ought not to put such questions until he has done something\r\nworthy, instead of saying that he could do it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they\r\nturned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy\r\nwalk, said, “I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,\r\nbut either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining\r\nanother attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your\r\nremaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any\r\ncase be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you\r\nunder that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the\r\nhappiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be\r\nthe nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.”\r\n\r\nMary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother’s manner\r\nbut at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the\r\nstrange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to\r\nhimself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had\r\nnever thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused\r\nher with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped\r\nshoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.\r\nFarebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle. She had only time\r\nto feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was\r\nclear and determined—her answer.\r\n\r\n“Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I\r\nhave too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else. I\r\nshould never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of\r\nme. It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always\r\nloving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time\r\nwhen we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to\r\nmake that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy\r\nof every one’s respect. But please tell him I will not promise to marry\r\nhim till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. He is\r\nfree to choose some one else.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,” said Mr. Farebrother,\r\nputting out his hand to Mary, “and I shall ride back to Middlemarch\r\nforthwith. With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the\r\nright niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God\r\nbless you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,” said Mary. Her eyes\r\nfilled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the\r\nresolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother’s manner, made her\r\nfeel suddenly miserable, as she had once felt when she saw her father’s\r\nhands trembling in a moment of trouble.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear, no. I must get back.”\r\n\r\nIn three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone\r\nmagnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of\r\nwhist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nIt is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what\r\noutsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead mechanism of “ifs” and\r\n“therefores” for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief\r\nand the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,\r\nhad naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one\r\nwhom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement\r\nand admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation\r\nat large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the\r\ndeeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother\r\n“read himself” into the quaint little church and preached his first\r\nsermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.\r\nIt was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to\r\nreside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the\r\nexcellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might\r\ngradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until\r\nit should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it\r\nas a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the\r\nadministration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side\r\nof Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which\r\nProvidence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A strong\r\nleading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising\r\nfacility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.\r\nRigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That\r\nwas what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in\r\nimagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by\r\nperspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to\r\nthe perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.\r\n\r\nBut how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We\r\njudge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always\r\nopen enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious\r\nJoshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was\r\nanything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had\r\ncertainly wished to call it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at\r\ngold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone\r\nCourt and thought of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense\r\nvision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited\r\nhaving taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good\r\nwas to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy\r\nin a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as\r\nother boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the\r\nfascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion;\r\nhe meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to\r\nmarry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys\r\nthat imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul\r\nthirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,\r\nto have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look\r\nsublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while\r\nhelpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an\r\niron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling\r\nhim to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when\r\nothers were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,\r\nJoshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he\r\nshould settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\nEnough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land\r\nfrom Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering\r\ndispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for\r\nsome time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it\r\nthus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded\r\nphraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of\r\nthe event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped\r\nregions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in\r\nan imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this\r\ndispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.\r\nFarebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.\r\n\r\nThis was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of\r\ndeceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his\r\nmode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen\r\nto disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories\r\ndoes not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is\r\nsatisfied, the more robust is our belief.\r\n\r\nHowever, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,\r\nhardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become\r\nthe proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were\r\nworthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of\r\nconversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned\r\non that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of\r\nhis cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of\r\ndelight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof\r\nthat it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the\r\ngenuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,\r\n“Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the\r\nalmshouses after all.”\r\n\r\nAffectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage\r\nwhich her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone\r\nCourt. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some\r\npart of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in\r\nthat quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending\r\nforth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One\r\nevening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in\r\ngolden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing\r\non horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\r\nmet him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable\r\ndrainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more\r\nthan usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He\r\nwas doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in\r\nhimself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when\r\nthe sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and\r\nrevive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be\r\nheld with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a\r\nmeasure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are\r\npeculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many\r\nmoods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this\r\nmoment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\r\nfar-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out\r\npreaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service\r\nof exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was\r\nhis own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted\r\nby the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just\r\nshaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?\r\nHe’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no\r\nreply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose\r\nappearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of\r\nblack and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman\r\nnow, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he\r\nwhirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and\r\nat last exclaiming:—\r\n\r\n“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the\r\nfive-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,\r\neh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To\r\nsay that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode\r\nof saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a\r\nmoment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his\r\nputting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—\r\n\r\n“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting\r\nhimself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m\r\nnot so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a\r\nletter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly\r\nfortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:\r\nhe’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the\r\ntruth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,\r\nfor—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.\r\n\r\nAlmost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger\r\non the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose\r\nacquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s\r\nlife so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they\r\nmust have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was\r\npeculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were\r\nalmost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about\r\npersonal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be\r\nfound out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and\r\nif he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\r\ndiscovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred\r\nhis horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must\r\nbe getting home,” set off at a trot.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.\r\n“That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The\r\nShrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the\r\nLondon concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural\r\nmansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady\r\nmust have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain\r\nof knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very\r\npale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your\r\nside.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.\r\nFive minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its\r\nevening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin\r\nseemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation\r\nan exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private\r\nvision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the\r\ndivine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red\r\nfigure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate\r\npast which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak\r\nrashly.\r\n\r\n“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you\r\ncan, if you please, rest here.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about\r\nseeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”\r\n\r\n“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am\r\nmaster here now.”\r\n\r\nRaffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before\r\nhe said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from\r\nthe coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I\r\nlike is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy\r\nin the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,\r\nold fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t\r\nsay so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking\r\nof improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”\r\n\r\nMr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\r\nswaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s\r\njudicious patience.\r\n\r\n“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\r\nacquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are\r\nnow assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the\r\nmore readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did\r\nnot lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more\r\nthan twenty years of separation.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my\r\nheart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings\r\nhave ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in\r\nthe house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac\r\nwas not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint\r\nof annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least\r\nclear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving\r\norders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a\r\nresolute air of quietude.\r\n\r\nThere was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the\r\nservice of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode\r\nentertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.\r\n\r\nWhen there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the\r\nwainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—\r\n\r\n“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly\r\nenjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will\r\ntherefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished\r\nto meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to\r\ntransact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to\r\nremain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early\r\nto-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any\r\ncommunication you have to make to me.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a\r\nlittle dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,\r\nwith this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the\r\nmorning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed\r\nme a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me\r\nthere was never anything but kindness.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and\r\nsneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had\r\ndetermined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words\r\nupon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the\r\ndifficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be\r\npermanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should\r\nwish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be\r\nregarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might\r\nhave sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument\r\nof good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a\r\nchastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very\r\ndifferent from the hours in which his struggle had been securely\r\nprivate, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were\r\npardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when\r\ncommitted—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\r\ndesire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the\r\ndivine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling\r\nand a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?\r\nWho would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,\r\nconfound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of\r\nobloquy?\r\n\r\nIn his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind\r\nclad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman\r\nends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s\r\norbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is\r\nthe stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic\r\nsuccession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and\r\nthe ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was\r\nthe forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his\r\nown wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,\r\ndepends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at\r\nescaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But\r\nMr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.\r\n\r\nIt was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again\r\nreached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a\r\ndelightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in\r\nflower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,\r\nwere running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around\r\nhad a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the\r\nowner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of\r\nMr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted\r\nparlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to\r\ntake at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening\r\nself was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;\r\nthe delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his\r\nspirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed\r\nmore disagreeable by the morning light.\r\n\r\n“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who\r\ncould hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without\r\neating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground\r\non which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home\r\nelsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”\r\n\r\n“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,\r\nNick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we\r\nknew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome\r\nfamily likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling\r\nyou Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to\r\nstay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up\r\nnow my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would\r\nas soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong\r\nwish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was\r\ntantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”\r\n\r\n“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish\r\nto stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to\r\nstay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles\r\nwinked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t\r\ncare about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little\r\ntravelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a\r\nman into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall\r\nback upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though\r\nI’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”\r\n\r\n“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a\r\ndistance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness\r\nin his undertone.\r\n\r\n“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see\r\nno reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not\r\nashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at\r\nthe turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more\r\nthan fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and\r\neverything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles\r\nhad pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at\r\nhis straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really\r\nthought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that\r\nhe was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which\r\nimplied solid connections.\r\n\r\n“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,\r\nafter a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I\r\nalways do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but\r\nlittle. I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling\r\nthe old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would\r\nhave suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart. But\r\nyou’ve buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it’s all one to her\r\nnow. And you’ve got your fortune out of that profitable business which\r\nhad such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land,\r\nbeing a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly?\r\nOr taken to the Church as more genteel?”\r\n\r\nThis time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue\r\nwas worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was\r\nnot a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering\r\nnausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he\r\nshould not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a\r\nslanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make\r\npeople disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth\r\nabout _you_,” said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no\r\nwrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the\r\ndirect falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look\r\nback on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax\r\ncustoms, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nBut since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time\r\nto the utmost.\r\n\r\n“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly\r\nwith me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of\r\ngentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came\r\nback—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade\r\nwas restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years\r\nby a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh and I never\r\nhit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and I’ve always\r\ntaken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the square with me;\r\nI’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look\r\nyou up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I\r\nthought you were trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t\r\nfind you there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a\r\nblessing to both of us.”\r\n\r\nMr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his intellect more\r\nsuperior to religious cant. And if the cunning which calculates on the\r\nmeanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,\r\nfor under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,\r\nthere was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so\r\nmany moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,\r\nand he said, with gathered resolution—\r\n\r\n“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a\r\nman to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.\r\nAlthough I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you\r\nwith a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a\r\npromise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your\r\npower to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short\r\ntime, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that reminds me of\r\na droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.”\r\n\r\n“Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white heat;\r\n“the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I\r\nshould never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your quarterly\r\npayment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”\r\n\r\nHere Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,\r\nswinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last\r\nhe stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a\r\ncouple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor\r\nbright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my\r\nliberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps\r\nit may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not.\r\nHave you the money with you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate\r\nriddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future\r\nuncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an\r\naddress.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take a\r\nstroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s sickly body, shattered by the agitations he had gone\r\nthrough since the last evening, made him feel abjectly in the power of\r\nthis loud invulnerable man. At that moment he snatched at a temporary\r\nrepose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles\r\nsuggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as if with a\r\nsudden recollection—\r\n\r\n“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you;\r\nI’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find\r\nher, but I found out her husband’s name, and I made a note of it. But\r\nhang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it\r\nagain. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names wear\r\nout, by Jove! Sometimes I’m no better than a confounded tax-paper\r\nbefore the names are filled in. However, if I hear of her and her\r\nfamily, you shall know, Nick. You’d like to do something for her, now\r\nshe’s your step-daughter.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his\r\nlight-gray eyes; “though that might reduce my power of assisting you.”\r\n\r\nAs he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and\r\nthen turned towards the window to watch the banker riding\r\naway—virtually at his command. His lips first curled with a smile and\r\nthen opened with a short triumphant laugh.\r\n\r\n“But what the deuce was the name?” he presently said, half aloud,\r\nscratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally. He had not\r\nreally cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it\r\noccurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a\r\nsense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was\r\ntoo slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men\r\nwere more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making\r\nthemselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He preferred using his\r\ntime in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,\r\nfrom whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr.\r\nBulstrode’s position in Middlemarch.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed\r\nrelieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone\r\nwith these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his\r\nknee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!” That action of memory which he had\r\ntried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly\r\ncompleted itself without conscious effort—a common experience,\r\nagreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no\r\nvalue. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\r\nname, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not\r\nbeing at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to\r\ntell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like\r\nthat of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that\r\nday he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the\r\ncoach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black spot on the\r\nlandscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the\r\nblack spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision\r\nof his hearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\nTHE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n“Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;\r\nPer che si fa gentil ciò ch’ella mira:\r\nOv’ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,\r\nE cui saluta fa tremar lo core.\r\n\r\nSicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,\r\nE d’ogni suo difetto allor sospira:\r\nFuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:\r\nAiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.\r\n\r\nOgni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile\r\nNasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;\r\nOnd’è beato chi prima la vide.\r\nQuel ch’ella par quand’ un poco sorride,\r\nNon si può dicer, nè tener a mente,\r\nSi è nuovo miracolo gentile.”\r\n—DANTE: _La Vita Nuova_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were\r\nscenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest\r\nworthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her abode at\r\nLowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive:\r\nto sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia’s\r\nbaby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that\r\nmomentous babe’s presence with persistent disregard was a course that\r\ncould not have been tolerated in a childless sister. Dorothea would\r\nhave been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had\r\nbeen need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an\r\naunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has\r\nnothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear\r\nmonotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. This\r\npossibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea’s\r\nchildless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little\r\nArthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke).\r\n\r\n“Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of her\r\nown—children or anything!” said Celia to her husband. “And if she had\r\nhad a baby, it never could have been such a dear as Arthur. Could it,\r\nJames?\r\n\r\n“Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of some\r\nindirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion\r\nas to the perfections of his first-born.\r\n\r\n“No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I think it\r\nis very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as fond of our\r\nbaby as if it were her own, and she can have as many notions of her own\r\nas she likes.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir James.\r\n\r\n“But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,”\r\nsaid Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. “I like\r\nher better as she is.”\r\n\r\nHence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her\r\nfinal departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with\r\ndisappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of\r\nsarcasm.\r\n\r\n“What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing to\r\nbe done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite\r\nmelancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with\r\nMr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is abroad, you and\r\nMr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does\r\neverything you tell him.”\r\n\r\n“I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the\r\nbetter,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is quite the\r\nbest part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did seem to her very\r\nhard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she might stay.\r\n\r\n“Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said Dorothea;\r\n“but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the\r\nFarebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is\r\nto be done in Middlemarch.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s native strength of will was no longer all converted into\r\nresolute submission. She had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was\r\nsimply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her reasons. But\r\nevery one around her disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and\r\noffered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months\r\nwith the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man\r\ncould hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.\r\n\r\nThe Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her daughter in\r\ntown, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and\r\ninvited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not\r\ncredible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in\r\nthe house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal\r\npersonages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea\r\ncould have nothing to object to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in that\r\nhouse alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert\r\nourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as\r\nother people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who\r\nhave no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care\r\nof then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little\r\nbored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might\r\nbecome yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing\r\ntragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that\r\nlibrary at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must\r\nget a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them.\r\nThat is a good lowering medicine.”\r\n\r\n“I never called everything by the same name that all the people about\r\nme did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.\r\n\r\n“But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,” she\r\nsaid, “I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken\r\nabout many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the\r\ngreater part of the world has often had to come round from its\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her\r\nhusband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again as soon\r\nas it is proper, if one could get her among the right people. Of course\r\nthe Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is the best\r\nthing to keep her in order. If we were not so poor I would invite Lord\r\nTriton. He will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that she\r\nwould make a good marchioness: she looks handsomer than ever in her\r\nmourning.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of\r\nno use,” said the easy Rector.\r\n\r\n“No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women\r\ntogether? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and\r\nshut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible\r\nmatches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely\r\nthe man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed\r\nsort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n“Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”\r\n\r\n“That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has\r\nno variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means taking the\r\nonly man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don’t\r\nexert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon\r\nbusiness yet.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore\r\npoint with Sir James. He would be deeply offended if you entered on it\r\nto him unnecessarily.”\r\n\r\n“I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands.\r\n“Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking\r\nof mine.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the\r\nyoung fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three significant\r\nnods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark eyes.\r\n\r\nDorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So\r\nby the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and\r\nthe morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of\r\nnote-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,\r\nthe mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with\r\nroses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose\r\noftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the\r\neighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if\r\nthey were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in\r\nthe library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all\r\nthe note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in\r\norderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling\r\nmotive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she\r\nremonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was\r\nunjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as\r\nsuperstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,\r\nshe carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, “I\r\ncould not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to\r\nyours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in—Dorothea?”\r\nThen she deposited the paper in her own desk.\r\n\r\nThat silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because\r\nunderneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which\r\nhad really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was to see\r\nWill Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of their\r\nmeeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to\r\nhim for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul thirsted to see him.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment had\r\nseen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come\r\nto her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with\r\nchoice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what\r\nwould she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which\r\nhad found her, and which she would know again. Life would be no better\r\nthan candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not\r\ntouched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It was\r\ntrue that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and\r\nespecially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering\r\nwhat Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,\r\nshe counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.\r\nThe very first Sunday, _before_ she entered the church, she saw him as\r\nshe had seen him the last time she was there, alone in the clergyman’s\r\npew; but _when_ she entered his figure was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she\r\nlistened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but\r\nit seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the\r\nneighborhood and out of it.\r\n\r\n“Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may follow him\r\nto Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said Dorothea, rather\r\ndespising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question.\r\n\r\n“If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,” said the old lady. “I see\r\nthat you set a right value on my son’s preaching. His grandfather on my\r\nside was an excellent clergyman, but his father was in the law:—most\r\nexemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never\r\nbeing rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes\r\nshe is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the\r\ncase with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction\r\nin her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea\r\nwanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know whether Will Ladislaw\r\nwas still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she dared to ask,\r\nunless it were Lydgate. But just now she could not see Lydgate without\r\nsending for him or going to seek him. Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having\r\nheard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it\r\nbetter that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong\r\nto wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.\r\nStill “I do wish it” came at the end of those wise reflections as\r\nnaturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the meeting did\r\nhappen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir with a\r\nmap of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her,\r\nwhich were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her\r\nincome and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but\r\nwas seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the\r\navenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the\r\nsunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent\r\nthe prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her\r\nown energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s\r\ncap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown\r\nstanding up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of\r\ncrape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the\r\nyounger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nHer reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw\r\nwas below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.\r\n\r\n“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown\r\ninto the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one\r\nleast associated with the trials of her married life: the damask\r\nmatched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two\r\ntall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room\r\nwhere you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in\r\nanother. It was below the boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking\r\nout on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into it the\r\nwindow was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then\r\nwithout minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and\r\nuninhabited.\r\n\r\n“Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to adjust a\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n“I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished even the\r\nbutler to know that he was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now\r\nshe was a rich widow.\r\n\r\n“Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a\r\nservant who was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which Ladislaw\r\nwas still ignorant, and had drawn his inferences; indeed, had not\r\ndiffered from his betrothed Tantripp when she said, “Your master was as\r\njealous as a fiend—and no reason. Madam would look higher than Mr.\r\nLadislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid says there’s a\r\nlord coming who is to marry her when the mourning’s over.”\r\n\r\nThere were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his\r\nhand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that\r\nfirst meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.\r\nThis time he felt miserable but determined, while she was in a state of\r\nagitation which could not be hidden. Just outside the door she had felt\r\nthat this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when she\r\nsaw Will advancing towards her, the deep blush which was rare in her\r\ncame with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but\r\nneither of them spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then they\r\nwent to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another\r\nopposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like\r\nDorothea that the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a\r\nchange in her manner of receiving him; and he knew of no other\r\ncondition which could have affected their previous relation to each\r\nother—except that, as his imagination at once told him, her friends\r\nmight have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions of him.\r\n\r\n“I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I could\r\nnot bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing\r\nyou to say good-by.”\r\n\r\n“Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not\r\nwished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect\r\ngenuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.\r\n“Are you going away immediately?”\r\n\r\n“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a\r\nbarrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public\r\nbusiness. There will be a great deal of political work to be done\r\nby-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed\r\nto win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.”\r\n\r\n“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,\r\nardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my\r\nuncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you\r\nleave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that\r\njustice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in\r\nRome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that\r\nadorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the\r\nrest of the world.”\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment,\r\nand had become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct\r\nglance, full of delighted confidence.\r\n\r\n“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here\r\nagain till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,\r\ntrying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get\r\nan expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.\r\n\r\nShe was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had turned\r\nher head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which\r\nseemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be\r\naway. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of\r\nstudying her manners: she thought only of bowing to a sad necessity\r\nwhich divided her from Will. Those first words of his about his\r\nintentions had seemed to make everything clear to her: he knew, she\r\nsupposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation to him,\r\nand it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He\r\nhad never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in\r\nhis mind to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the\r\nfeelings of both: and that friendship he still felt. Something which\r\nmay be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she\r\nsaid with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only\r\nfrom its liquid flexibility—\r\n\r\n“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy\r\nwhen I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have\r\npatience. It will perhaps be a long while.”\r\n\r\nWill never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling\r\ndown at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle\r\ntremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her crape\r\ndress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He sat still,\r\nhowever, and only said—\r\n\r\n“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dorothea, “I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten\r\nany one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not\r\nlikely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick,\r\nhaven’t I?” She smiled.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in\r\nhis hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned\r\nand leaned his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and\r\nneck, and he looked almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were\r\nlike two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence,\r\nwhile their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But\r\nthere was no help for it. It should never be true of him that in this\r\nmeeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a\r\nconfession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.\r\nMoreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which\r\nsuch confessions might have on Dorothea herself.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him from that distance in some trouble, imagining that\r\nthere might have been an offence in her words. But all the while there\r\nwas a current of thought in her about his probable want of money, and\r\nthe impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle had been at home,\r\nsomething might have been done through him! It was this preoccupation\r\nwith the hardship of Will’s wanting money, while she had what ought to\r\nhave been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained\r\nsilent and looked away from her—\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs\r\nup-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I think\r\nit is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it. It is\r\nwonderfully like you.”\r\n\r\n“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it.\r\nIt is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It would be more\r\nconsoling if others wanted to have it.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea\r\nbroke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from\r\nAunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a\r\nfamily memorial.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a\r\nportmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head.”\r\n\r\nWill spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it was a\r\nlittle too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him\r\nat that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar\r\nsting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as\r\nhauteur—\r\n\r\n“You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.”\r\n\r\nWill was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a\r\ndismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way\r\ntowards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.\r\nSomething was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to\r\nconjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of\r\nhimself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held\r\nby Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand\r\nher present feeling.\r\n\r\n“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But\r\npoverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most\r\ncare for.”\r\n\r\nThe words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent. She answered\r\nin a tone of sad fellowship.\r\n\r\n“Sorrow comes in so many ways. Two years ago I had no notion of that—I\r\nmean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our hands,\r\nand makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to despise women a\r\nlittle for not shaping their lives more, and doing better things. I was\r\nvery fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given it up,” she\r\nended, smiling playfully.\r\n\r\n“I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,”\r\nsaid Will. He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of\r\ncontradictory desires and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof\r\nthat she loved him, and yet dreading the position into which such a\r\nproof might bring him. “The thing one most longs for may be surrounded\r\nwith conditions that would be intolerable.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Pratt entered and said, “Sir James Chettam is in the\r\nlibrary, madam.”\r\n\r\n“Ask Sir James to come in here,” said Dorothea, immediately. It was as\r\nif the same electric shock had passed through her and Will. Each of\r\nthem felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while\r\nthey awaited Sir James’s entrance.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands with Dorothea, he bowed as slightly as possible to\r\nLadislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards\r\nDorothea, said—\r\n\r\n“I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while.”\r\n\r\nDorothea put out her hand and said her good-by cordially. The sense\r\nthat Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to him,\r\nroused her resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in\r\nher manner. And when Will had left the room, she looked with such calm\r\nself-possession at Sir James, saying, “How is Celia?” that he was\r\nobliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him. And what would be the\r\nuse of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much\r\ndislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw\r\nas her possible lover, that he would himself have wished to avoid an\r\noutward show of displeasure which would have recognized the\r\ndisagreeable possibility. If any one had asked him why he shrank in\r\nthat way, I am not sure that he would at first have said anything\r\nfuller or more precise than “_That_ Ladislaw!”—though on reflection he\r\nmight have urged that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil, barring Dorothea’s\r\nmarriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast\r\nunfitness over any relation at all between them. His aversion was all\r\nthe stronger because he felt himself unable to interfere.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself. Entering at\r\nthat moment, he was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through\r\nwhich Will’s pride became a repellent force, keeping him asunder from\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nHath she her faults? I would you had them too.\r\nThey are the fruity must of soundest wine;\r\nOr say, they are regenerating fire\r\nSuch as hath turned the dense black element\r\nInto a crystal pathway for the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that\r\nour elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth to think\r\nits emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each\r\ncrisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are told that the\r\noldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be agitated by the\r\nearthquakes, but they probably see beyond each shock, and reflect that\r\nthere are plenty more to come.\r\n\r\nTo Dorothea, still in that time of youth when the eyes with their long\r\nfull lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied\r\nas a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning’s parting with Will\r\nLadislaw seemed to be the close of their personal relations. He was\r\ngoing away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back\r\nhe would be another man. The actual state of his mind—his proud resolve\r\nto give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the\r\nneedy adventurer seeking a rich woman—lay quite out of her imagination,\r\nand she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her\r\nsupposition that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil seemed to him, as it did to\r\nher, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them.\r\nTheir young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one\r\nelse would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of\r\nthe past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check.\r\nThat unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber\r\nshe might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at. For\r\nthe first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it\r\nbefore her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged\r\nwith the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one\r\nwho has rejoiced in woman’s tenderness think it a reproach to her that\r\nshe took the little oval picture in her palm and made a bed for it\r\nthere, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the\r\ncreatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then\r\nthat it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before\r\nawaking, with the hues of morning on his wings—that it was Love to whom\r\nshe was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless\r\nrigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something\r\nirrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the\r\nfuture were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready\r\nto construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the\r\nfulfilment of their own visions.\r\n\r\nOne day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of staying all\r\nnight and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector\r\nbeing gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in\r\nthe delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the\r\nopen window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was\r\nenough to make Celia in her white muslin and light curls reflect with\r\npity on what Dodo must feel in her black dress and close cap. But this\r\nwas not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind\r\nat leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time\r\nbefore she said, in her quiet guttural—\r\n\r\n“Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you\r\nfeel ill.”\r\n\r\n“I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said Dorothea,\r\nsmiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.”\r\n\r\n“I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia, throwing\r\ndown her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see\r\nthis little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow’s cap from her\r\nmore majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils\r\nand braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the\r\nroom. He looked at the released head, and said, “Ah!” in a tone of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make such a\r\nslavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at\r\nleast a year.”\r\n\r\n“Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\r\nwho had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir\r\nJames was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia’s Maltese dog.\r\n\r\n“That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to\r\nguard against such events. “No friend of ours ever committed herself in\r\nthat way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell\r\nwhen she did so. Her first husband was objectionable, which made it the\r\ngreater wonder. And severely she was punished for it. They said Captain\r\nBeevor dragged her about by the hair, and held up loaded pistols at\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a\r\ndecidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or second.\r\nPriority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other.\r\nI would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady Chettam. “I\r\nam sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our\r\ndear Rector were taken away.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to\r\nmarry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of\r\nChristians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she must take\r\nthe consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her fate. But\r\nif she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.”\r\n\r\n“I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir\r\nJames, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”\r\n\r\n“Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to lose\r\nthe opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to\r\nexcellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you\r\nthat no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than\r\nsecond marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going\r\nfox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow\r\nthem. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much\r\nas on any other.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest way, “you\r\ndo not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning\r\nMrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She was\r\nstep-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second\r\nwife. There could be no possible allusion to you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of\r\nDodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman\r\ncould not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend again. I\r\nwill not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk about?\r\nI, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature, because that\r\nis the nature of rectors’ wives.”\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said\r\nprivately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like\r\nyourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to\r\ndo, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make\r\nout whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”\r\n\r\n“Neither,” said Dorothea. “James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he\r\nwas mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I\r\nshould only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of\r\nblood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.”\r\n\r\n“But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better\r\nto have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had\r\nnot been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to\r\ncaution Dorothea in time.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I\r\nshall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin,\r\nand looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her\r\nbaby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her.\r\n\r\n“Really—quite?” said Celia. “Not anybody at all—if he were very\r\nwonderful indeed?”\r\n\r\nDorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful\r\nplans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and drain it, and\r\nmake a little colony, where everybody should work, and all the work\r\nshould be done well. I should know every one of the people and be their\r\nfriend. I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can\r\ntell me almost everything I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia.\r\n“Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he\r\ncan help you.”\r\n\r\nSir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite\r\nset against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all\r\nsorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James made no\r\nremark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a\r\nwoman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it\r\na sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that the world would\r\nregard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a\r\nwoman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of\r\na young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to\r\nsmile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did\r\nchoose to espouse her solitude, he felt that the resolution would well\r\nbecome her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n“How happy is he born and taught\r\nThat serveth not another’s will;\r\nWhose armor is his honest thought,\r\nAnd simple truth his only skill!\r\n. . . . . . .\r\nThis man is freed from servile bands\r\nOf hope to rise or fear to fall;\r\nLord of himself though not of lands;\r\nAnd having nothing yet hath all.”\r\n—SIR HENRY WOTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea’s confidence in Caleb Garth’s knowledge, which had begun on\r\nher hearing that he approved of her cottages, had grown fast during her\r\nstay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her to take rides over the\r\ntwo estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her\r\nadmiration, and told his wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for\r\nbusiness most uncommon in a woman. It must be remembered that by\r\n“business” Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful\r\napplication of labor.\r\n\r\n“Most uncommon!” repeated Caleb. “She said a thing I often used to\r\nthink myself when I was a lad:—‘Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I\r\nlived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a\r\ngreat many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while\r\nit is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.’\r\nThose were the very words: she sees into things in that way.”\r\n\r\n“But womanly, I hope,” said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.\r\nCasaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you can’t think!” said Caleb, shaking his head. “You would like to\r\nhear her speak, Susan. She speaks in such plain words, and a voice like\r\nmusic. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and\r\nstraightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising\r\nGod and saying;’ it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.”\r\n\r\nCaleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear\r\nan oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a\r\nprofound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him\r\nsit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable\r\nlanguage into his outstretched hands.\r\n\r\nWith this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea\r\nasked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three\r\nfarms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his\r\nexpectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he\r\nsaid, “Business breeds.” And one form of business which was beginning\r\nto breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line\r\nwas to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed\r\nin a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the\r\ninfant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\r\nCaleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to\r\ntwo persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its\r\ndifficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various\r\nlanded proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but\r\nsentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were\r\nas exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of\r\nCholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were\r\nwomen and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by\r\nsteam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying\r\nthat nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\r\nproprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as\r\nMr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet\r\nunanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of\r\nmankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies\r\nmust be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to\r\ninjure mankind.\r\n\r\nBut the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both\r\noccupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this\r\nconclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it\r\nwould be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered\r\nbits, which would be “nohow;” while accommodation-bridges and high\r\npayments were remote and incredible.\r\n\r\n“The cows will all cast their calves, brother,” said Mrs. Waule, in a\r\ntone of deep melancholy, “if the railway comes across the Near Close;\r\nand I shouldn’t wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal. It’s a poor\r\ntale if a widow’s property is to be spaded away, and the law say\r\nnothing to it. What’s to hinder ’em from cutting right and left if they\r\nbegin? It’s well known, _I_ can’t fight.”\r\n\r\n“The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send ’em\r\naway with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,”\r\nsaid Solomon. “Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can understand.\r\nIt’s all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced\r\nto take one way. Let ’em go cutting in another parish. And I don’t\r\nbelieve in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to\r\ntrample your crops. Where’s a company’s pocket?”\r\n\r\n“Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,” said Mrs.\r\nWaule. “But that was for the manganese. That wasn’t for railways to\r\nblow you to pieces right and left.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering\r\nhis voice in a cautious manner—“the more spokes we put in their wheel,\r\nthe more they’ll pay us to let ’em go on, if they must come whether or\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\nThis reasoning of Mr. Solomon’s was perhaps less thorough than he\r\nimagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of\r\nrailways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or\r\ncatarrh of the solar system. But he set about acting on his views in a\r\nthoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His side of\r\nLowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the\r\nlaboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet\r\ncalled Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little\r\ncentre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public\r\nopinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy\r\ncorner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding\r\nrather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that\r\nsuspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor\r\nof Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,\r\nthere being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to\r\nfatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”\r\nwho would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the\r\nthree neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without\r\ndistinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing\r\nwith the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every\r\nknowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given\r\nto fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to\r\nbelieve that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard\r\nheaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition\r\nobservable in the weather.\r\n\r\nThus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon\r\nFeatherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same\r\norder, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and\r\nmore entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that\r\ntime, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look\r\nat the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious\r\ndeliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had\r\nsome other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\r\nAfter looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would\r\nraise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake\r\nhis bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly\r\nonward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.\r\nSolomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow. He\r\nwas in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat with\r\nevery hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to\r\nlisten even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an\r\nadvantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,\r\nhowever, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\r\nhimself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had\r\nseen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called\r\nthemselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or\r\nwhat they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were\r\ngoing to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.\r\n\r\n“Why, there’ll be no stirrin’ from one pla-ace to another,” said Hiram,\r\nthinking of his wagon and horses.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this\r\nparish! Let ’em go into Tipton, say I. But there’s no knowing what\r\nthere is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for’ard; but\r\nit’s to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.”\r\n\r\n“Why, they’re Lunnon chaps, I reckon,” said Hiram, who had a dim notion\r\nof London as a centre of hostility to the country.\r\n\r\n“Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard\r\nsay, the folks fell on ’em when they were spying, and broke their\r\npeep-holes as they carry, and drove ’em away, so as they knew better\r\nthan come again.”\r\n\r\n“It war good foon, I’d be bound,” said Hiram, whose fun was much\r\nrestricted by circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t meddle with ’em myself,” said Solomon. “But some say\r\nthis country’s seen its best days, and the sign is, as it’s being\r\noverrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut\r\nit up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the\r\nlittle, so as there shan’t be a team left on the land, nor a whip to\r\ncrack.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll crack _my_ whip about their ear’n, afore they bring it to that,\r\nthough,” said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his bridle, moved\r\nonward.\r\n\r\nNettle-seed needs no digging. The ruin of this countryside by railroads\r\nwas discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the\r\nhay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for\r\ntalk such as were rarely had through the rural year.\r\n\r\nOne morning, not long after that interview between Mr. Farebrother and\r\nMary Garth, in which she confessed to him her feeling for Fred Vincy,\r\nit happened that her father had some business which took him to\r\nYoddrell’s farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value\r\nan outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb\r\nexpected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be\r\nconfessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms\r\nfrom railroad companies). He put up his gig at Yoddrell’s, and in\r\nwalking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his\r\nwork, he encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were\r\nadjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them,\r\nobserving that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going\r\nto measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which\r\nbecome delicious about twelve o’clock, when the clouds part a little,\r\nand the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the\r\nhedgerows.\r\n\r\nThe scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along\r\nthe lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by\r\nunsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on\r\none side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on\r\nthe other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the\r\nworking-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman\r\nwithout capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred’s\r\ndisposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer\r\nrebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\r\npleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on\r\nwhat he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But\r\nit must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the\r\nmore difficult task:—what secular avocation on earth was there for a\r\nyoung man (whose friends could not get him an “appointment”) which was\r\nat once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special\r\nknowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening\r\nhis pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by\r\nLowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one\r\nfield to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on the far\r\nside of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in\r\nsmock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach\r\ntowards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth\r\nand his assistant were hastening across the field to join the\r\nthreatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the\r\ngate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks,\r\nwhose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after\r\nswallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before\r\nthem with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth’s assistant, a lad of\r\nseventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb’s order, had\r\nbeen knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had\r\nthe advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in\r\nfront of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw\r\ntheir chase into confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?”\r\nshouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right\r\nand left with his whip. “I’ll swear to every one of you before the\r\nmagistrate. You’ve knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I\r\nknow. You’ll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you\r\ndon’t mind,” said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he\r\nremembered his own phrases.\r\n\r\nThe laborers had been driven through the gate-way into their hay-field,\r\nand Fred had checked his horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a\r\nsafe challenging distance, turned back and shouted a defiance which he\r\ndid not know to be Homeric.\r\n\r\n“Yo’re a coward, yo are. Yo git off your horse, young measter, and I’ll\r\nhave a round wi’ ye, I wull. Yo daredn’t come on wi’out your hoss an’\r\nwhip. I’d soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, and I’ll come back presently, and have a round with you\r\nall in turn, if you like,” said Fred, who felt confidence in his power\r\nof boxing with his dearly beloved brethren. But just now he wanted to\r\nhasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.\r\n\r\nThe lad’s ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he\r\nwas no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might\r\nride to Yoddrell’s and be taken care of there.\r\n\r\n“Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can\r\ncome back for their traps,” said Fred. “The ground is clear now.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Caleb, “here’s a breakage. They’ll have to give up for\r\nto-day, and it will be as well. Here, take the things before you on the\r\nhorse, Tom. They’ll see you coming, and they’ll turn back.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I happened to be here at the right moment, Mr. Garth,” said\r\nFred, as Tom rode away. “No knowing what might have happened if the\r\ncavalry had not come up in time.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, it was lucky,” said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and\r\nlooking towards the spot where he had been at work at the moment of\r\ninterruption. “But—deuce take it—this is what comes of men being\r\nfools—I’m hindered of my day’s work. I can’t get along without somebody\r\nto help me with the measuring-chain. However!” He was beginning to move\r\ntowards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he had forgotten Fred’s\r\npresence, but suddenly he turned round and said quickly, “What have you\r\ngot to do to-day, young fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Mr. Garth. I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred,\r\nwith a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“Well, you mustn’t mind stooping and getting hot.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind anything. Only I want to go first and have a round with\r\nthat hulky fellow who turned to challenge me. It would be a good lesson\r\nfor him. I shall not be five minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation. “I shall\r\ngo and speak to the men myself. It’s all ignorance. Somebody has been\r\ntelling them lies. The poor fools don’t know any better.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go with you, then,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“No, no; stay where you are. I don’t want your young blood. I can take\r\ncare of myself.”\r\n\r\nCaleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of\r\nhurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he felt it his\r\nduty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a\r\nstriking mixture in him—which came from his having always been a\r\nhard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and\r\npractical indulgence towards them. To do a good day’s work and to do it\r\nwell, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of\r\nhis own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them.\r\nWhen he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again,\r\nbut were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each\r\nturning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three\r\nyards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one\r\nhand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his\r\nwaistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.\r\n\r\n“Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,\r\nwhich seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying\r\nunder them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to\r\npeep above the water. “How came you to make such a mistake as this?\r\nSomebody has been telling you lies. You thought those men up there\r\nwanted to do mischief.”\r\n\r\n“Aw!” was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his\r\ndegree of unreadiness.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! No such thing! They’re looking out to see which way the\r\nrailroad is to take. Now, my lads, you can’t hinder the railroad: it\r\nwill be made whether you like it or not. And if you go fighting against\r\nit, you’ll get yourselves into trouble. The law gives those men leave\r\nto come here on the land. The owner has nothing to say against it, and\r\nif you meddle with them you’ll have to do with the constable and\r\nJustice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch jail. And you\r\nmight be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.”\r\n\r\nCaleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have\r\nchosen either his pause or his images better for the occasion.\r\n\r\n“But come, you didn’t mean any harm. Somebody told you the railroad was\r\na bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to\r\nthis and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway’s a\r\ngood thing.”\r\n\r\n“Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,” said old Timothy\r\nCooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been\r\ngone on their spree;—“I’n seen lots o’ things turn up sin’ I war a\r\nyoung un—the war an’ the peace, and the canells, an’ the oald King\r\nGeorge, an’ the Regen’, an’ the new King George, an’ the new un as has\r\ngot a new ne-ame—an’ it’s been all aloike to the poor mon. What’s the\r\ncanells been t’ him? They’n brought him neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor\r\nwage to lay by, if he didn’t save it wi’ clemmin’ his own inside. Times\r\nha’ got wusser for him sin’ I war a young un. An’ so it’ll be wi’ the\r\nrailroads. They’ll on’y leave the poor mon furder behind. But them are\r\nfools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here. This is the big folks’s\r\nworld, this is. But yo’re for the big folks, Muster Garth, yo are.”\r\n\r\nTimothy was a wiry old laborer, of a type lingering in those times—who\r\nhad his savings in a stocking-foot, lived in a lone cottage, and was\r\nnot to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal\r\nspirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally\r\nunacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man. Caleb was in\r\na difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and\r\nunassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of\r\nan undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,\r\nand can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument\r\nfor a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at\r\ncommand, even if he could have chosen to use it; and he had been\r\naccustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing\r\nhis “business” faithfully. He answered—\r\n\r\n“If you don’t think well of me, Tim, never mind; that’s neither here\r\nnor there now. Things may be bad for the poor man—bad they are; but I\r\nwant the lads here not to do what will make things worse for\r\nthemselves. The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won’t help ’em to\r\nthrow it over into the roadside pit, when it’s partly their own\r\nfodder.”\r\n\r\n“We war on’y for a bit o’ foon,” said Hiram, who was beginning to see\r\nconsequences. “That war all we war arter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I’ll see that nobody informs\r\nagainst you.”\r\n\r\n“I’n ne’er meddled, an’ I’n no call to promise,” said Timothy.\r\n\r\n“No, but the rest. Come, I’m as hard at work as any of you to-day, and\r\nI can’t spare much time. Say you’ll be quiet without the constable.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, we wooant meddle—they may do as they loike for oos”—were the forms\r\nin which Caleb got his pledges; and then he hastened back to Fred, who\r\nhad followed him, and watched him in the gateway.\r\n\r\nThey went to work, and Fred helped vigorously. His spirits had risen,\r\nand he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the\r\nhedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers. Was it his\r\nsuccessful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping\r\nMary’s father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had helped\r\nhis frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself which had\r\nseveral attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in Mr. Garth’s\r\nmind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very end which now\r\nrevealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is but the touch of\r\nfire where there is oil and tow; and it always appeared to Fred that\r\nthe railway brought the needed touch. But they went on in silence\r\nexcept when their business demanded speech. At last, when they had\r\nfinished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said—\r\n\r\n“A young fellow needn’t be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?”\r\n\r\n“I wish I had taken to it before I had thought of being a B. A.,” said\r\nFred. He paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, “Do you\r\nthink I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?”\r\n\r\n“My business is of many sorts, my boy,” said Mr. Garth, smiling. “A\r\ngood deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can’t learn\r\nit off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to\r\nlay a foundation yet.” Caleb pronounced the last sentence emphatically,\r\nbut paused in some uncertainty. He had been under the impression lately\r\nthat Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.\r\n\r\n“You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?” said Fred,\r\nmore eagerly.\r\n\r\n“That depends,” said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering\r\nhis voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying\r\nsomething deeply religious. “You must be sure of two things: you must\r\nlove your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting\r\nyour play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your\r\nwork, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something\r\nelse. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it\r\nwell, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had\r\nthis or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man\r\nis—I wouldn’t give twopence for him”—here Caleb’s mouth looked bitter,\r\nand he snapped his fingers—“whether he was the prime minister or the\r\nrick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”\r\n\r\n“I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,” said\r\nFred, meaning to take a step in argument.\r\n\r\n“Then let it alone, my boy,” said Caleb, abruptly, “else you’ll never\r\nbe easy. Or, if you _are_ easy, you’ll be a poor stick.”\r\n\r\n“That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,” said Fred, coloring.\r\n“I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does\r\nnot displease you that I have always loved her better than any one\r\nelse, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.”\r\n\r\nThe expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.\r\nBut he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said—\r\n\r\n“That makes things more serious, Fred, if you want to take Mary’s\r\nhappiness into your keeping.”\r\n\r\n“I know that, Mr. Garth,” said Fred, eagerly, “and I would do anything\r\nfor _her_. She says she will never have me if I go into the Church; and\r\nI shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of\r\nMary. Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything\r\nthat I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good\r\nopinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good\r\ndeal about land and cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though\r\nyou will think me rather foolish for it—that I should have land of my\r\nown. I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me,\r\nespecially if I could be under you in any way.”\r\n\r\n“Softly, my boy,” said Caleb, having the image of “Susan” before his\r\neyes. “What have you said to your father about all this?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I\r\ncan do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint\r\nhim, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is\r\nfour-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be\r\nright for me to do now? My education was a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of\r\nyou, or would ever have you?”\r\n\r\n“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I\r\ndidn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says\r\nthat I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable\r\nposition—I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it\r\nunwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my\r\nown wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.\r\nOf course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have already a debt to\r\nyou which will never be discharged, even when I have been able to pay\r\nit in the shape of money.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, you have a claim,” said Caleb, with much feeling in his\r\nvoice. “The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them\r\nforward. I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but\r\nhelp would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the\r\nfellow-feeling’s sake. But I must consider. Come to me to-morrow at the\r\noffice, at nine o’clock. At the office, mind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it\r\nmust be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his\r\nresolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other\r\nmen are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in\r\nthe world. He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had\r\nsaid that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to\r\nsave, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring into details.\r\nBut where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a\r\nruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every\r\none about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he\r\nwas absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one\r\nelse’s behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the\r\nhundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the\r\nsingularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to\r\nmake herself subordinate.\r\n\r\n“It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were\r\nseated alone in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure\r\nwhich had brought about Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back\r\nthe further result. “The children _are_ fond of each other—I mean, Fred\r\nand Mary.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes\r\nanxiously on her husband.\r\n\r\n“After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear\r\nto be a clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and\r\nthe lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business. And\r\nI’ve determined to take him and make a man of him.”\r\n\r\n“Caleb!” said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine thing to do,” said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly\r\nagainst the back of his chair, and grasping the elbows. “I shall have\r\ntrouble with him, but I think I shall carry it through. The lad loves\r\nMary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan. It\r\nshapes many a rough fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?” said Mrs Garth, secretly a\r\nlittle hurt that she had to be informed on it herself.\r\n\r\n“Not a word. I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a\r\nwarning. But she assured me she would never marry an idle\r\nself-indulgent man—nothing since. But it seems Fred set on Mr.\r\nFarebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden him to speak\r\nhimself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred,\r\nbut says he must not be a clergyman. Fred’s heart is fixed on Mary,\r\nthat I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always\r\nliked him, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity for Mary, I think,” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n\r\n“Why—a pity?”\r\n\r\n“Because, Caleb, she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred\r\nVincy’s.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?” said Caleb, with surprise.\r\n\r\n“I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to\r\nmake her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an\r\nenvoy, there is an end to that better prospect.” There was a severe\r\nprecision in Mrs. Garth’s utterance. She was vexed and disappointed,\r\nbut she was bent on abstaining from useless words.\r\n\r\nCaleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He looked\r\nat the floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some\r\ninward argumentation. At last he said—\r\n\r\n“That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have\r\nbeen glad for your sake. I’ve always felt that your belongings have\r\nnever been on a level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\nconvinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of\r\nthat mark.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would\r\nhave been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred.\r\nThe lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the\r\nright way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she\r\nhas given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out. I say,\r\nthat young man’s soul is in my hand; and I’ll do the best I can for\r\nhim, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling\r\ndown her face before her husband had finished. It came from the\r\npressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and\r\nsome vexation. She wiped it away quickly, saying—\r\n\r\n“Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in\r\nthat way, Caleb.”\r\n\r\n“That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear\r\nfeeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will\r\ngo with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,\r\npoor child.”\r\n\r\nCaleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards\r\nhis wife. She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our\r\nchildren have a good father.”\r\n\r\nBut she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of\r\nher words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be\r\nmisunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which\r\nwould turn out to have the more foresight in it—her rationality or\r\nCaleb’s ardent generosity?\r\n\r\nWhen Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be\r\ngone through which he was not prepared for.\r\n\r\n“Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always\r\ndone a good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as\r\nI want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your\r\nhead, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How\r\nare you at writing and arithmetic?”\r\n\r\nFred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of\r\ndesk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m\r\nnot afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I\r\nthink you know my writing.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and\r\nhanding it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me\r\na line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.”\r\n\r\nAt that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to\r\nwrite legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred\r\nwrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any\r\nviscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the\r\nconsonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had\r\na blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line—in short,\r\nit was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you\r\nknow beforehand what the writer means.\r\n\r\nAs Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when\r\nFred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped\r\nthe paper passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this\r\ndispelled all Caleb’s mildness.\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country\r\nwhere a man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns\r\nyou out this!” Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles\r\nand looking at the unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us,\r\nFred, I can’t put up with this!”\r\n\r\n“What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,\r\nnot only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of\r\nhimself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.\r\n\r\n“Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s\r\nthe use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb,\r\nenergetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is\r\nthere so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles\r\nover the country? But that’s the way people are brought up. I should\r\nlose no end of time with the letters some people send me, if Susan did\r\nnot make them out for me. It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nAny stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered\r\nwhat was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the\r\nfine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather\r\npatchy as he bit his lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with\r\nmany thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the\r\nbeginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been\r\nat a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He had not thought\r\nof desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he wanted\r\nan occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell\r\nwhat might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised\r\nhimself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was\r\nengaged to work under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr.\r\nGarth was already relenting.\r\n\r\n“We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his\r\nusual quiet tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at\r\nit with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll\r\nbe patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while\r\nyou are learning. But now I must be off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must\r\nlet your father know our agreement. You’ll save me Callum’s salary, you\r\nknow, when you can write; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds\r\nfor the first year, and more after.”\r\n\r\nWhen Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative\r\neffect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his\r\nmemory. He went straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse,\r\nrightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave\r\nto his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and\r\nformally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly\r\nunderstood to be final, if the interview took place in his father’s\r\ngravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the\r\nwarehouse.\r\n\r\nFred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had\r\ndone and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he\r\nshould be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the\r\nblame on his own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired\r\nFred with strong, simple words.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an\r\nexclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of\r\nunusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that\r\nmorning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he\r\nlistened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,\r\nduring which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key\r\nemphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—\r\n\r\n“So you’ve made up your mind at last, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, father.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; stick to it. I’ve no more to say. You’ve thrown away your\r\neducation, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means\r\nof rising, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much\r\nof a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a\r\ncurate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope,\r\nwhen you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the\r\npains you spend on him.”\r\n\r\nThis was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair\r\nadvantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and\r\nsee our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,\r\nMr. Vincy’s wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,\r\ninconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the\r\ndisappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were\r\nbeing banished with a malediction.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said,\r\nafter rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my\r\nboard, as of course I should wish to do.”\r\n\r\n“Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at\r\nthe notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course\r\nyour mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,\r\nyou understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a\r\nsuit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for ’em.”\r\n\r\nFred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the\r\nvexation I have caused you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who\r\nhad advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,\r\n“Yes, yes, let us say no more.”\r\n\r\nFred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother,\r\nbut she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her\r\nhusband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary\r\nGarth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual\r\ninfusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his\r\nbeautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody else’s son in\r\nMiddlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness of\r\nappearance and carelessness about his clothes. To her it seemed that\r\nthere was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,\r\nbut she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it\r\nhad made him “fly out” at her as he had never done before. Her temper\r\nwas too sweet for her to show any anger, but she felt that her\r\nhappiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at\r\nFred made her cry a little as if he were the subject of some baleful\r\nprophecy. Perhaps she was the slower to recover her usual cheerfulness\r\nbecause Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the sore question\r\nwith his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him. If her\r\nhusband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged into\r\ndefence of her darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr. Vincy\r\nsaid to her—\r\n\r\n“Come, Lucy, my dear, don’t be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled\r\nthe boy, and you must go on spoiling him.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,” said the wife, her fair\r\nthroat and chin beginning to tremble again, “only his illness.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh, never mind! We must expect to have trouble with our\r\nchildren. Don’t make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t,” said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting\r\nherself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\n“It won’t do to begin making a fuss about one,” said Mr. Vincy, wishing\r\nto combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness. “There’s\r\nRosamond as well as Fred.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, poor thing. I’m sure I felt for her being disappointed of her\r\nbaby; but she got over it nicely.”\r\n\r\n“Baby, pooh! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice, and\r\ngetting into debt too, by what I hear. I shall have Rosamond coming to\r\nme with a pretty tale one of these days. But they’ll get no money from\r\nme, I know. Let _his_ family help him. I never did like that marriage.\r\nBut it’s no use talking. Ring the bell for lemons, and don’t look dull\r\nany more, Lucy. I’ll drive you and Louisa to Riverston to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nThey numbered scarce eight summers when a name\r\n    Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there\r\nAs thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame\r\n    At penetration of the quickening air:\r\nHis name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,\r\n    Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,\r\nMaking the little world their childhood knew\r\n    Large with a land of mountain lake and scaur,\r\nAnd larger yet with wonder, love, belief\r\n    Toward Walter Scott who living far away\r\nSent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.\r\n    The book and they must part, but day by day,\r\n        In lines that thwart like portly spiders ran\r\n        They wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had begun to\r\nsee that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must\r\nsometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set out at five\r\no’clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself\r\nthat she accepted their new relations willingly.\r\n\r\nHe found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great\r\napple-tree in the orchard. It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her\r\neldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a\r\nshort holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the\r\nworld to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate\r\nPorson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of\r\nobject-lesson given to him by the educational mother. Christy himself,\r\na square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not\r\nmuch higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he\r\nshould be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought\r\nno more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s,\r\nwishing that he himself were more of the same height. He was lying on\r\nthe ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over\r\nhis eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that\r\nbeloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young\r\nlives. The volume was “Ivanhoe,” and Jim was in the great archery scene\r\nat the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who had\r\nfetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself dreadfully\r\ndisagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to observe his\r\nrandom shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the\r\nactive-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled\r\nNewfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality\r\nof extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and pinafore\r\nsome slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering of the\r\ncherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated\r\non the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading.\r\n\r\nBut the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred\r\nVincy. When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on\r\nhis way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and\r\nsnatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s\r\noutstretched leg, and said “Take me!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, and me too,” said Letty.\r\n\r\n“You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose\r\nlife was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.\r\n\r\n“I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he\r\nhad the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up\r\nto her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And\r\nthat old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father\r\nwill come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary that you\r\nare here, and she will come back to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nChristy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s\r\nbeautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the\r\nadvantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of\r\nlooking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang about\r\nyour friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits.”\r\n\r\nThe eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt\r\nthat Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he\r\nhad to say, but he could only begin by observing—\r\n\r\n“How glad you must be to have Christy here!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the coach at\r\nnine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing for Caleb to\r\ncome and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He has paid\r\nhis expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on hard\r\nstudy at the same time. He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go\r\nabroad.”\r\n\r\n“He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a\r\nmedicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight pause, he\r\nadded, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of\r\ntrouble to Mr. Garth.”\r\n\r\n“Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always do more\r\nthan any one would have thought of asking them to do,” answered Mrs.\r\nGarth. She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she\r\nchose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with\r\nsalutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,\r\nshe did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.\r\n\r\n“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good\r\nreason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of\r\nsomething like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved\r\njust the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the most from.\r\nBut while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me\r\nup, I don’t see why I should give myself up.” Fred thought it might be\r\nwell to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom\r\ntwo such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he\r\nthrew himself away and made their sacrifices vain.”\r\n\r\nFred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope\r\nit will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement\r\nto believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You\r\nwere not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only\r\nto his own love as probably evident enough.\r\n\r\n“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs.\r\nGarth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the\r\nfact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this\r\nbeforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was\r\nsurprised.”\r\n\r\n“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to\r\nher myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr.\r\nFarebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a\r\nhope.”\r\n\r\nThe power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not\r\nyet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for _her_\r\nself-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\r\ndisappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a\r\nnightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family\r\nshould suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her\r\nvexation had fermented the more actively because of its total\r\nrepression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find\r\nscapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, “You made\r\na great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”\r\n\r\n“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a\r\nloss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,\r\n“Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I\r\nknew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite\r\nreadily.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own\r\nwishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said\r\nMrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general\r\ndoctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her\r\nworsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.\r\n\r\n“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said\r\nFred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning\r\nto form themselves.\r\n\r\n“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as\r\nneatly as possible.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and\r\nthen turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with\r\nMary?”\r\n\r\n“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to\r\nbe surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her\r\nand folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that\r\nshe should put her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were\r\ndivided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the\r\nsense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and\r\nrose quickly.\r\n\r\n“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said,\r\nin a tone which seemed to demand an answer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She had brought herself into\r\nthe unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,\r\nyet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her\r\nthe consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly\r\nmortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he\r\nnow added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to\r\nme. He could not have known anything of this.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the\r\nfear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily\r\nendurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences—\r\n\r\n“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything\r\nof the matter.”\r\n\r\nBut she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject\r\nwhich she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop\r\nin that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of\r\nunintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things\r\nstood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and\r\nseeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,\r\nshouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,\r\njumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and\r\nswept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted\r\nsock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness,\r\nwhile Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it\r\nwas a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack\r\nbuilt.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came\r\nup and the _tête-à-tête_ with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he\r\ncould, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her\r\nseverity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with him.\r\n\r\nShe was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of\r\nspeaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and\r\nentreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to\r\nprevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all\r\nto him that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild\r\nCaleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she meant to point out\r\nto him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick.\r\nFred’s light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise\r\nas from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might\r\nhave made a thoroughly good match. Also he was piqued that he had been\r\nwhat he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.\r\nFarebrother. But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s,\r\nthat the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount\r\nevery other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity,\r\nnotwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling\r\nthat he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it\r\nextremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good,\r\nbeing ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the\r\nfighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was\r\nmuch more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this\r\nexperience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his\r\ndisappointment about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into\r\nhis soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It\r\ndid not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.\r\nFarebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary. Mary\r\nhad been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know\r\nvery little of what had been passing in her mind.\r\n\r\nHe did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the\r\nthree ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on\r\nsome subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying\r\nthe labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute\r\nhandwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in\r\nthe village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar\r\nrelation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that\r\nthey should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that\r\nhe should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He\r\ntold her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with\r\nher father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news\r\ntouched her keenly. She said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent\r\nover her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was\r\na subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a\r\nyoung man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean\r\nthat things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent\r\nman like your father.”\r\n\r\n“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary,\r\ncleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully\r\nsecular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield\r\nand Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n\r\n“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden\r\nknitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason\r\nfor your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the\r\nquestion those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike\r\nclergymen?”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to\r\nconsider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” said Mary. “I don’t like the other clergymen’s neckcloths,\r\nbecause it is they who wear them.”\r\n\r\n“How very puzzling!” said Miss Noble, feeling that her own intellect\r\nwas probably deficient.\r\n\r\n“My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than these for\r\nslighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother,\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\n“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is\r\ndifficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my\r\nson,” said the old lady.\r\n\r\nMary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in\r\nand had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the\r\nend he said with quiet satisfaction, “_That_ is right;” and then bent\r\nto look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting. Fred felt horribly\r\njealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but\r\nwished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It\r\nwas clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother\r\nabove everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the\r\naffair. He was feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking\r\nto Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said—\r\n\r\n“Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you have never\r\nseen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you to see a\r\nstupendous spider I found this morning.”\r\n\r\nMary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the\r\nmemorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards her,\r\nand her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was\r\naccustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a\r\nbelief flattered her vanity she felt warned to dismiss it as\r\nridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was\r\nas she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of\r\nthe study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“Wait here a minute or two. I am going to look out an engraving which\r\nFred is tall enough to hang for me. I shall be back in a few minutes.”\r\nAnd then he went out. Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary\r\nwas—\r\n\r\n“It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry\r\nFarebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,\r\nand surprised out of all her readiness in reply.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who\r\nsee everything.”\r\n\r\n“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.\r\nFarebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you\r\nhave taken up such an idea?”\r\n\r\nFred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had really\r\nbeen unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what Mrs. Garth had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are\r\ncontinually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set\r\nup above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”\r\n\r\n“You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never told\r\nMr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world\r\nif it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he was very\r\nkind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at the work with a\r\nwill, writing and everything, if it were not for this.”\r\n\r\n“For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something specific\r\nmust have been said or done.\r\n\r\n“This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.”\r\nMary was appeased by her inclination to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Fred,” she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were sulkily\r\nturned away from her, “you are too delightfully ridiculous. If you were\r\nnot such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play\r\nthe wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has\r\nmade love to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of\r\naffection on her, and trying to take her hand.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like you at all at this moment,” said Mary, retreating, and\r\nputting her hands behind her. “I only said that no mortal ever made\r\nlove to me besides you. And that is no argument that a very wise man\r\never will,” she ended, merrily.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of\r\nhim,” said Fred.\r\n\r\n“Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,” said Mary, getting\r\nserious again. “I don’t know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous in\r\nyou not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose\r\nthat we might speak freely. I am disappointed that you should be so\r\nblind to his delicate feeling.”\r\n\r\nThere was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with\r\nthe engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a\r\njealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from\r\nMary’s words and manner. The result of the conversation was on the\r\nwhole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new\r\nattitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations. She was\r\nin a position in which she seemed to herself to be slighting Mr.\r\nFarebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is\r\nalways dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman. To have a reason\r\nfor going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to\r\nbe always clear that she loved Fred best. When a tender affection has\r\nbeen storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we\r\ncould accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.\r\nAnd we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can\r\nover other treasures.\r\n\r\n“Fred has lost all his other expectations; he must keep this,” Mary\r\nsaid to herself, with a smile curling her lips. It was impossible to\r\nhelp fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities and an acknowledged\r\nvalue of which she had often felt the absence. But these things with\r\nFred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking sad for the want of her,\r\ncould never tempt her deliberate thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n“For there can live no hatred in thine eye,\r\nTherefore in that I cannot know thy change:\r\nIn many’s looks the false heart’s history\r\nIs writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange:\r\nBut Heaven in thy creation did decree\r\nThat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell:\r\nWhate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be\r\nThy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.”\r\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when Mr. Vincy uttered that presentiment about Rosamond,\r\nshe herself had never had the idea that she should be driven to make\r\nthe sort of appeal which he foresaw. She had not yet had any anxiety\r\nabout ways and means, although her domestic life had been expensive as\r\nwell as eventful. Her baby had been born prematurely, and all the\r\nembroidered robes and caps had to be laid by in darkness. This\r\nmisfortune was attributed entirely to her having persisted in going out\r\non horseback one day when her husband had desired her not to do so; but\r\nit must not be supposed that she had shown temper on the occasion, or\r\nrudely told him that she would do as she liked.\r\n\r\nWhat led her particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit from\r\nCaptain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to say, was\r\ndetested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop “parting his hair\r\nfrom brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not followed by Tertius\r\nhimself), and showing an ignorant security that he knew the proper\r\nthing to say on every topic. Lydgate inwardly cursed his own folly that\r\nhe had drawn down this visit by consenting to go to his uncle’s on the\r\nwedding-tour, and he made himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond by\r\nsaying so in private. For to Rosamond this visit was a source of\r\nunprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation. She was so intensely\r\nconscious of having a cousin who was a baronet’s son staying in the\r\nhouse, that she imagined the knowledge of what was implied by his\r\npresence to be diffused through all other minds; and when she\r\nintroduced Captain Lydgate to her guests, she had a placid sense that\r\nhis rank penetrated them as if it had been an odor. The satisfaction\r\nwas enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the\r\nconditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed\r\nnow that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her above\r\nthe Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and\r\nvisits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence\r\nfor Tertius. Especially as, probably at the Captain’s suggestion, his\r\nmarried sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come with her maid, and stayed two\r\nnights on her way from town. Hence it was clearly worth while for\r\nRosamond to take pains with her music and the careful selection of her\r\nlace.\r\n\r\nAs to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline nose bent on\r\none side, and his rather heavy utterance, might have been\r\ndisadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military bearing\r\nand mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond\r\nheads as “style.” He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which\r\nconsists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class\r\ngentility, and he was a great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond\r\ndelighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at\r\nQuallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in\r\nflirting with her. The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest\r\nlarks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected\r\nthat his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who\r\nwould rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in\r\npolite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended\r\ngenerally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the\r\ntask of answering him to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous\r\nhusband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone\r\nwith his wife to bearing him company.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner, Tertius,” said\r\nRosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to Loamford to\r\nsee some brother officers stationed there. “You really look so absent\r\nsometimes—you seem to be seeing through his head into something behind\r\nit, instead of looking at him.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Rosy, you don’t expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass\r\nas that, I hope,” said Lydgate, brusquely. “If he got his head broken,\r\nI might look at it with interest, not before.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so\r\ncontemptuously,” said Rosamond, her fingers moving at her work while\r\nshe spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in it.\r\n\r\n“Ask Ladislaw if he doesn’t think your Captain the greatest bore he\r\never met with. Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he came.”\r\n\r\nRosamond thought she knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw disliked the\r\nCaptain: he was jealous, and she liked his being jealous.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she\r\nanswered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman,\r\nand I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him\r\nwith neglect.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear; but we have had dinners for him. And he comes in and goes\r\nout as he likes. He doesn’t want me.”\r\n\r\n“Still, when he is in the room, you might show him more attention. He\r\nmay not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his profession is\r\ndifferent; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on\r\nhis subjects. _I_ think his conversation is quite agreeable. And he is\r\nanything but an unprincipled man.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him, Rosy,”\r\nsaid Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not\r\nexactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did\r\nnot smile again; but the lovely curves of her face looked good-tempered\r\nenough without smiling.\r\n\r\nThose words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he\r\nhad travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared\r\nto be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s\r\nmind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and\r\nlooking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored\r\nwisdom alone. He had begun to distinguish between that imagined\r\nadoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives\r\nhim prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable\r\nbefore his name.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she\r\nhad found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly\r\nwearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is\r\nunendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,\r\nindeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s stupidity\r\nwas delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good\r\naccent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite\r\nagreeable and caught many of its phrases.\r\n\r\nTherefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were\r\nplenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when\r\nCaptain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him\r\nand put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray\r\nwhich he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he\r\nhad bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.\r\nRosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came\r\nback before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,\r\nand she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was\r\ninformed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go\r\nriding again.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded\r\nthat she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the\r\nmatter to his wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of\r\nastonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he\r\nwas silent for some moments.\r\n\r\n“However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a decisive\r\ntone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were the\r\nquietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be the\r\nchance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to give up\r\nriding the roan on that account.”\r\n\r\n“But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”\r\n\r\n“My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;\r\n“surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I\r\nsay you are not to go again.”\r\n\r\nRosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of\r\nher head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a\r\nlittle turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he\r\nawaited some assurance.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,” said Rosamond, letting\r\nher arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband ashamed of\r\nstanding there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened the plaits\r\nbefore, being among the deftest of men with his large finely formed\r\nfingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the\r\ntall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what could he do then but\r\nkiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves? But\r\nwhen we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.\r\nLydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his point.\r\n\r\n“I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer\r\nyou his horse,” he said, as he moved away.\r\n\r\n“I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said Rosamond,\r\nlooking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. “It\r\nwill be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will leave\r\nthe subject to me.”\r\n\r\nThere did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said, “Very\r\nwell,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his\r\npromising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.\r\n\r\nIn fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that\r\nvictorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous\r\nresistance. What she liked to do was to her the right thing, and all\r\nher cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She meant\r\nto go out riding again on the gray, and she did go on the next\r\nopportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending that he should know\r\nuntil it was late enough not to signify to her. The temptation was\r\ncertainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the\r\ngratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir\r\nGodwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in\r\nthis position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her\r\ndreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with\r\nthe family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being\r\nfelled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse\r\nfright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate\r\ncould not show his anger towards her, but he was rather bearish to the\r\nCaptain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end.\r\n\r\nIn all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly certain\r\nthat the ride had made no difference, and that if she had stayed at\r\nhome the same symptoms would have come on and would have ended in the\r\nsame way, because she had felt something like them before.\r\n\r\nLydgate could only say, “Poor, poor darling!”—but he secretly wondered\r\nover the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There was gathering\r\nwithin him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over Rosamond. His\r\nsuperior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he had\r\nimagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on\r\nevery practical question. He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as\r\nprecisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He was now\r\nbeginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into\r\nwhich it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one\r\nquicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the\r\ntrack of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s\r\npreeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively\r\ntracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have\r\nadvanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had\r\nno other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the\r\nfortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with\r\nwhich she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own opinion\r\nmore than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless\r\ntrifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,\r\nthat affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the\r\naffection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything\r\nto repel it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as\r\ntenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations;\r\nbut—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in\r\nhis life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to a creature that has\r\nbeen used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in\r\nthe clearest of waters.\r\n\r\nRosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her worktable, enjoying\r\ndrives in her father’s phaeton and thinking it likely that she might be\r\ninvited to Quallingham. She knew that she was a much more exquisite\r\nornament to the drawing-room there than any daughter of the family, and\r\nin reflecting that the gentlemen were aware of that, did not perhaps\r\nsufficiently consider whether the ladies would be eager to see\r\nthemselves surpassed.\r\n\r\nLydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she\r\ninwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his\r\nthoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as\r\nthat uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if\r\nthey were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of\r\nweather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter states of\r\nmind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but\r\nmistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her\r\nhealth and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total\r\nmissing of each other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible\r\neven between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To\r\nLydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in\r\nsacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his\r\ntenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions\r\nwithout impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of\r\nbitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the\r\nblank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more\r\nimpersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor\r\nwhich he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as\r\nsublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was\r\nmingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we\r\nshall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,\r\nwife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been\r\ngreater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate\r\nwas aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than\r\nthe lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize\r\nan enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our\r\nlives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a\r\nsimple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading\r\ncare, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.\r\n\r\nThis was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to\r\nRosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered\r\nher mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It\r\nwas an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily\r\ndrawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he could\r\nnot succeed in keeping out of his mind for long together that he was\r\nevery day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it\r\nwith such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful how\r\nsoon a man gets up to his chin there—in a condition in which, in spite\r\nof himself, he is forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a\r\nscheme of the universe in his soul.\r\n\r\nEighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager\r\nwant of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who\r\ndescended a step in order to gain them. He was now experiencing\r\nsomething worse than a simple deficit: he was assailed by the vulgar\r\nhateful trials of a man who has bought and used a great many things\r\nwhich might have been done without, and which he is unable to pay for,\r\nthough the demand for payment has become pressing.\r\n\r\nHow this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or\r\nknowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for\r\nmarriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to\r\nbetween four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay\r\nfor; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses,\r\nhorses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds\r\nof the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred\r\nper annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,\r\nchiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he\r\nminds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than\r\nour own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease\r\nwith which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought\r\nthat he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied\r\nwithout stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent\r\nfor house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts,\r\ncan be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath\r\nhis consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an\r\nextravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply\r\nin ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate\r\nsupposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done\r\nproperly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head\r\nof household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would\r\nhave probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any\r\none had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the\r\nsubstitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him\r\nsimply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an\r\noccasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations,\r\nand Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not\r\ninterfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional\r\nprudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate\r\nwas constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his\r\nprescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by\r\nthis time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in\r\nmen, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by\r\nside and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness\r\nand errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own\r\npersonality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is\r\nmanifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate\r\nbelieved himself to be careless about his dress, and he despised a man\r\nwho calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed to him only a\r\nmatter of course that he had abundance of fresh garments—such things\r\nwere naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he had\r\nnever hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he walked by\r\nhabit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come.\r\n\r\nIts novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that\r\nconditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected\r\nwith the objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in\r\nambush and clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the\r\nactual debt; there was the certainty that in his present position he\r\nmust go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose\r\nbills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated\r\ncurrent expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had\r\nrepeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on\r\nhis attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any\r\ndisposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of\r\nasking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned\r\neven to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters,\r\nand nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his\r\nfather-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect\r\nways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not\r\nflourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be\r\nresented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had\r\nnever in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should\r\nneed to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but\r\nnow that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather\r\nincur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects\r\nof money; and his practice was not getting more lucrative.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward\r\ntrouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining\r\nbrilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on\r\nhis difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his\r\nreasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider\r\nfrom a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods\r\nordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits. How could\r\nsuch a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate\r\noccasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.\r\n\r\nHaving no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security\r\ncould possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered\r\nthe one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who\r\nwas a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself\r\nthe upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term. The\r\nsecurity necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house,\r\nwhich might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt\r\namounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr.\r\nDover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate\r\nand any other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was\r\na phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some\r\npurple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a\r\nbridal present.\r\n\r\nOpinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some\r\nmay think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man\r\nlike Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in\r\nthe pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered\r\nno conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not\r\nproportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous\r\nfastidiousness about asking his friends for money.\r\n\r\nHowever, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine\r\nmorning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence\r\nof other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of\r\nwhich the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for\r\nornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could\r\nhardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.\r\nBut at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help dwelling on the\r\npossibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.\r\nDover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to\r\nRosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never\r\nbeen in the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this\r\ndiscernment with some of the rigor (by no means all) that he would have\r\napplied in pursuing experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as\r\nhe rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must\r\nmake to Rosamond.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this\r\nstrong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying\r\nangrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake; but the\r\nmistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic disease, mingling\r\nits uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every\r\nthought. As he went along the passage to the drawing-room, he heard the\r\npiano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some weeks\r\nsince Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old post\r\nin Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s\r\ncoming, but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth\r\nfree. When he opened the door the two singers went on towards the\r\nkey-note, raising their eyes and looking at him indeed, but not\r\nregarding his entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his\r\nharness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people\r\nwarbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that the painful day has\r\nstill pains in store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a\r\nscowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.\r\n\r\nThe singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only\r\nthree bars to sing, now turned round.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.\r\n\r\nLydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.\r\n\r\n“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond,\r\nwho had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She\r\nseated herself in her usual place as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly,\r\nstill scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWill was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching\r\nhis hat.\r\n\r\n“Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension of\r\nLydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his manner, easily\r\nimagining outdoor causes of annoyance.\r\n\r\n“There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond, playfully, and\r\nin her lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all the evening.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone. “I have\r\nsome serious business to speak to you about.”\r\n\r\nNo introduction of the business could have been less like that which\r\nLydgate had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too\r\nprovoking.\r\n\r\n“There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the\r\nMechanics’ Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room.\r\n\r\nRosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her\r\nplace before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him\r\nso disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as\r\nshe delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and\r\nlooked at the objects immediately before her with no curve in her face\r\ndisturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her air against all\r\npeople with unpleasant manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his\r\nwound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine\r\nimpassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he had\r\nonce interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His\r\nmind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said\r\ninwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is\r\nthe way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men\r\nso much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was\r\nimmediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from\r\nthe behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of\r\nemotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her\r\npassionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose\r\nsake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the\r\nyearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions\r\nsucceeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind while the\r\ntea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of\r\nreverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can\r\ndo—he has been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds\r\nabout nothing else—and I mind about nothing else.”\r\n\r\nThat voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the\r\nenkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within\r\nhim (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over\r\nhuman spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a music from\r\nwhich he was falling away—he had really fallen into a momentary doze,\r\nwhen Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way, “Here is your tea,\r\nTertius,” setting it on the small table by his side, and then moved\r\nback to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty in\r\nattributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was\r\nsensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was\r\none of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had\r\nnever raised her voice: she was quite sure that no one could justly\r\nfind fault with her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before;\r\nbut there were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if\r\nhe had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of\r\nthe angry desire to rouse her into more sensibility on his account\r\nwhich had prompted him to speak prematurely, still mingled with his\r\npain in the prospect of her pain. But he waited till the tray was gone,\r\nthe candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on: the\r\ninterval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the old\r\ncourse. He spoke kindly.\r\n\r\n“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,\r\npushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nRosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent\r\nfaintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more\r\ngraceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his\r\nchair, at last looking at him and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck\r\nand cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty\r\nwhich touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness. It\r\ntouched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her\r\nwith all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep\r\ntrouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—\r\n\r\n“Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.\r\nRosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her\r\nhusband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred\r\ndelight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead, then laid her\r\nother hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are\r\nthings which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it has\r\noccurred to you already that I am short of money.”\r\n\r\nLydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a vase on\r\nthe mantel-piece.\r\n\r\n“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were\r\nmarried, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged\r\nto meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three\r\nhundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while,\r\nand in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don’t pay me\r\nthe faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from\r\nyou while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,\r\nand you must help me.”\r\n\r\n“What can _I_ do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him\r\nagain. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all\r\nlanguages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all\r\nstates of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative\r\nperception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most\r\nneutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the words “What\r\ncan—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell like a\r\nmortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not storm in\r\nindignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he spoke\r\nagain it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a\r\ntime, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”\r\n\r\nRosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?” she said,\r\nas soon as she could speak.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from Lydgate’s,\r\nand rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him.\r\n\r\n“No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do that. The\r\ninventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it\r\nwill make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it\r\nthat your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added\r\nLydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.\r\n\r\nThis certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil\r\nexpectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady\r\ndisobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not\r\ngiven to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to\r\ntremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for\r\nLydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of\r\nhis own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully\r\nwhat this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing\r\nbut indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more\r\nexactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could,\r\nand her tears cut him to the heart. He could not speak again\r\nimmediately; but Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer\r\nher agitation and wiped away her tears, continuing to look before her\r\nat the mantel-piece.\r\n\r\n“Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up towards\r\nher. That she had chosen to move away from him in this moment of her\r\ntrouble made everything harder to say, but he must absolutely go on.\r\n“We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary. It is I who have been\r\nin fault: I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in this\r\nway. But many things have told against me in my practice, and it really\r\njust now has ebbed to a low point. I may recover it, but in the mean\r\ntime we must pull up—we must change our way of living. We shall weather\r\nit. When I have given this security I shall have time to look about me;\r\nand you are so clever that if you turn your mind to managing you will\r\nschool me into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal about\r\nsquaring prices—but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was bowing his neck under the yoke like a creature who had\r\ntalons, but who had Reason too, which often reduces us to meekness.\r\nWhen he had spoken the last words in an imploring tone, Rosamond\r\nreturned to the chair by his side. His self-blame gave her some hope\r\nthat he would attend to her opinion, and she said—\r\n\r\n“Why can you not put off having the inventory made? You can send the\r\nmen away to-morrow when they come.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not send them away,” said Lydgate, the peremptoriness rising\r\nagain. Was it of any use to explain?\r\n\r\n“If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and that\r\nwould do as well.”\r\n\r\n“But we are not going to leave Middlemarch.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure, Tertius, it would be much better to do so. Why can we not\r\ngo to London? Or near Durham, where your family is known?”\r\n\r\n“We can go nowhere without money, Rosamond.”\r\n\r\n“Your friends would not wish you to be without money. And surely these\r\nodious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to wait, if you\r\nwould make proper representations to them.”\r\n\r\n“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take\r\nmy judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary\r\narrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no\r\nexpectations whatever from them, and shall not ask them for anything.”\r\n\r\nRosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that if she\r\nhad known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.\r\n\r\n“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said\r\nLydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want\r\nto consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate\r\nback again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really behaves very\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very\r\nlips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was\r\ndetermined to make no further resistance or suggestions.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a\r\npaper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I\r\nhave marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would\r\nreduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any of\r\nthe jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery\r\nvery bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe\r\nargument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she should return any\r\nparticular present of his, but he had told himself that he was bound to\r\nput Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make the\r\naffair easy.\r\n\r\n“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you\r\nwill return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper,\r\nand Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let\r\nit fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room,\r\nleaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she not coming back? It\r\nseemed that she had no more identified herself with him than if they\r\nhad been creatures of different species and opposing interests. He\r\ntossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his pockets with a sort\r\nof vengeance. There was still science—there were still good objects to\r\nwork for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other\r\nsatisfactions were going.\r\n\r\nBut the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather\r\nbox containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which\r\ncontained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been\r\nsitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—\r\n\r\n“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you\r\nlike of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me\r\nto stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”\r\n\r\nTo many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more\r\nterrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the\r\ndistance she was placing between them.\r\n\r\n“And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter edge on\r\nhis accent.\r\n\r\n“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to\r\nmamma.” Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more\r\nirreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at her\r\nwork-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was\r\nthat he said, with some of the old emotion in his tone—\r\n\r\n“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in\r\nthe first trouble that has come.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it becomes me to\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“It is not right that the thing should be left to servants, or that I\r\nshould have to speak to them about it. And I shall be obliged to go\r\nout—I don’t know how early. I understand your shrinking from the\r\nhumiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a\r\nquestion of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely\r\nbetter to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as\r\nlittle of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no\r\nhindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”\r\n\r\nRosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very well,\r\nI will stay at home.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I will\r\nwrite out a list of plate that we may return, and that can be packed up\r\nand sent at once.”\r\n\r\n“The servants will know _that_,” said Rosamond, with the slightest\r\ntouch of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the\r\nink, I wonder?” said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account on the\r\nlarger table where he meant to write.\r\n\r\nRosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table\r\nwas going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close by, put\r\nhis arm round her and drew her towards him, saying—\r\n\r\n“Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a\r\ntime, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular. Kiss me.”\r\n\r\nHis native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a\r\npart of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an\r\ninexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him. She received\r\nhis kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of\r\naccord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could not help looking\r\nforward with dread to the inevitable future discussions about\r\nexpenditure and the necessity for a complete change in their way of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\n“They said of old the Soul had human shape,\r\nBut smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,\r\nSo wandered forth for airing when it pleased.\r\nAnd see! beside her cherub-face there floats\r\nA pale-lipped form aerial whispering\r\nIts promptings in that little shell her ear.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNews is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen\r\nwhich the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when\r\nthey are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. This fine\r\ncomparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick\r\nParsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which\r\ntheir old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon’s\r\nstrange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his will made not long\r\nbefore his death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that her brother\r\nhad known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most\r\nwonderful man for knowing things and not telling them; whereupon Mary\r\nGarth said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of\r\nspiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother\r\nconsidered that the news had something to do with their having only\r\nonce seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small\r\ncompassionate mewings.\r\n\r\nFred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and\r\nhis mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on\r\nRosamond at his mother’s request to deliver a message as he passed, he\r\nhappened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to\r\nsay to each other now that marriage had removed her from collision with\r\nthe unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he had taken\r\nwhat she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the\r\nChurch to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by\r\npreference of what he considered indifferent news, and “a propos of\r\nthat young Ladislaw” mentioned what he had heard at Lowick Parsonage.\r\n\r\nNow Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than he told,\r\nand when he had once been set thinking about the relation between Will\r\nand Dorothea his conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He imagined that\r\nthere was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck him as\r\nmuch too serious to gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability\r\nwhen he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On\r\nthe whole his surmises, in addition to what he knew of the fact,\r\nincreased his friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made him\r\nunderstand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had\r\nsaid that he should go away. It was significant of the separateness\r\nbetween Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak\r\nto her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence\r\ntowards Will. And he was right there; though he had no vision of the\r\nway in which her mind would act in urging her to speak.\r\n\r\nWhen she repeated Fred’s news to Lydgate, he said, “Take care you don’t\r\ndrop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He is likely to fly out as if\r\nyou insulted him. Of course it is a painful affair.”\r\n\r\nRosamond turned her neck and patted her hair, looking the image of\r\nplacid indifference. But the next time Will came when Lydgate was away,\r\nshe spoke archly about his not going to London as he had threatened.\r\n\r\n“I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird,” said she,\r\nshowing very pretty airs of her head over the bit of work held high\r\nbetween her active fingers. “There is a powerful magnet in this\r\nneighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you,” said Will,\r\nwith light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.\r\n\r\n“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and\r\nforeseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much\r\nlike to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her as a\r\ncertain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her\r\nforfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and then—and\r\nthen—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic.”\r\n\r\n“Great God! what do you mean?” said Will, flushing over face and ears,\r\nhis features seeming to change as if he had had a violent shake. “Don’t\r\njoke; tell me what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t really know?” said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring\r\nnothing better than to tell in order that she might evoke effects.\r\n\r\n“No!” he returned, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs.\r\nCasaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.” Will started up from\r\nhis chair and reached his hat.\r\n\r\n“I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said Rosamond,\r\nlooking at him from a distance.\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t say any more about it,” said Will, in a hoarse undertone\r\nextremely unlike his usual light voice. “It is a foul insult to her and\r\nto me.” Then he sat down absently, looking before him, but seeing\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“Now you are angry with _me_,” said Rosamond. “It is too bad to bear\r\n_me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you.”\r\n\r\n“So I am,” said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul\r\nwhich belongs to dreamers who answer questions.\r\n\r\n“I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond, playfully.\r\n\r\n“Never! You will never hear of the marriage!”\r\n\r\nWith those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his hand to\r\nRosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end\r\nof the room, leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere, and\r\nlooking out of the window wearily. She was oppressed by ennui, and by\r\nthat dissatisfaction which in women’s minds is continually turning into\r\na trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no\r\ndeeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable\r\nof impelling action as well as speech. “There really is nothing to care\r\nfor much,” said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at\r\nQuallingham, who did not write to her; and that perhaps Tertius when he\r\ncame home would tease her about expenses. She had already secretly\r\ndisobeyed him by asking her father to help them, and he had ended\r\ndecisively by saying, “I am more likely to want help myself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nGood phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.\r\n—_Justice Shallow_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was an\r\noccasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it\r\nchose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished\r\nauspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures\r\nwhich anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind,\r\nbelonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This was not one of the sales\r\nindicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr.\r\nLarcher’s great success in the carrying business, which warranted his\r\npurchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by\r\nan illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls\r\nof expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was\r\nnervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence\r\nthe fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the\r\nhandbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history\r\nof art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without\r\nreserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.\r\n\r\nAt Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of\r\nfestival. There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a\r\nsuperior funeral; and facilities were offered for that\r\ngenerous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and\r\ncheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr. Larcher’s sale was the\r\nmore attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the\r\nend of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant\r\nissue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road\r\nto the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as\r\nthe Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all\r\nclasses with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in\r\norder simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the\r\nraces. The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold,\r\n“everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s,\r\nhad looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and\r\nhad rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a\r\nwreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large\r\ntable in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with\r\ndesk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were\r\noften varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the\r\nlarge bow-window opening on to the lawn.\r\n\r\n“Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could\r\nnot well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had\r\nparticularly wished to have a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,”\r\nattributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the\r\nday of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the\r\n“Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr.\r\nLadislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable\r\nknowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the\r\nvalue of this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite\r\nbanker, “attendance at the sale would not interfere with the\r\narrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.”\r\n\r\nThis proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he\r\nhad been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an\r\nunderstanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of\r\nthe paper, that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over\r\nthe management to the subeditor whom he had been training; since he\r\nwished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite visions of ambition\r\nare weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly\r\nagreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve\r\nwhen we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such\r\nstates of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning\r\ntowards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be\r\nfulfilled, still—very wonderful things have happened! Will did not\r\nconfess this weakness to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of\r\ngoing to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would\r\nremember him were not there; and so far as political writing was\r\nconcerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At\r\nthe present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he\r\nhad both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not\r\nto go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had\r\nreasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go\r\nto the sale.\r\n\r\nWill was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with\r\nthe thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact\r\ntantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs\r\nwhich were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like most people\r\nwho assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he\r\nwas prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might\r\nhint that he had personal reasons for that assertion—that there was\r\nanything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave\r\nthe mask of an opinion. When he was under an irritating impression of\r\nthis kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color\r\nchanging in his transparent skin as if he were on the _qui vive_,\r\nwatching for something which he had to dart upon.\r\n\r\nThis expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those\r\nwho had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright\r\nenjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He was not sorry to\r\nhave this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch\r\ntribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an\r\nadventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante—who\r\nsneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much\r\nin need of crossing. He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the\r\nauctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown\r\nbackward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially\r\nwelcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the\r\nutmost activity of his great faculties.\r\n\r\nAnd surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their\r\npowers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer\r\nkeenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic\r\nknowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be\r\nconstantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to\r\n“Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins;\r\nhe was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe\r\nunder his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him.\r\nWhen Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been\r\nforgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s\r\nenthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising\r\nthose things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of\r\npolished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.\r\n\r\n“Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which\r\nat any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I\r\nmay say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of\r\nthing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal,\r\ntrimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with\r\nordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style of\r\nworkmanship will be the only one in vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank\r\nyou—going at half-a-crown, this characteristic fender; and I have\r\nparticular information that the antique style is very much sought after\r\nin high quarters. Three shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up,\r\nJoseph! Look, ladies, at the chastity of the design—I have no doubt\r\nmyself that it was turned out in the last century! Four shillings, Mr.\r\nMawmsey?—four shillings.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not a thing I would put in _my_ drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey,\r\naudibly, for the warning of the rash husband. “I wonder _at_ Mrs.\r\nLarcher. Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut\r\nin two. The edge is like a knife.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly\r\nuseful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather\r\nshoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand:\r\nmany a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him\r\ndown. Gentlemen, here’s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang\r\nyourselves would cut you down in no time—with astonishing\r\ncelerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an appropriate thing\r\nfor a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest a little\r\nout of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going at six\r\nshillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had been\r\nsearching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of\r\nbidding, here dropped on the paper before him, and his voice too\r\ndropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said, “Mr. Clintup.\r\nBe handy, Joseph.”\r\n\r\n“It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that\r\njoke on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his next\r\nneighbor. He was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and\r\nfeared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now,\r\nladies,” said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, “this tray\r\ncontains a very recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the\r\ndrawing-room table—and trifles make the sum _of_ human things—nothing\r\nmore important than trifles—(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)—but\r\npass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must be examined, ladies. This\r\nI have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance—a sort of practical\r\nrebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant\r\nheart-shaped box, portable—for the pocket; there, again, it becomes\r\nlike a splendid double flower—an ornament for the table; and now”—Mr.\r\nTrumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of\r\nheart-shaped leaves—“a book of riddles! No less than five hundred\r\nprinted in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I\r\nshould not wish you to bid high for this lot—I have a longing for it\r\nmyself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more\r\nthan a good riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to\r\nthe society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without\r\nthe elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high\r\nprice to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual\r\nwelcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?—four shillings for this\r\nremarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a\r\nsample: ‘How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds?\r\nAnswer—money.’ You hear?—lady-birds—honey money. This is an amusement\r\nto sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it has what we call satire,\r\nand wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence—five shillings.”\r\n\r\nThe bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and\r\nthis was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted\r\nto hinder every other man from making a figure. The current carried\r\neven Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of himself to an opinion\r\nfell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression, that\r\nthe bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths\r\nof Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what Horrock would do with blasted\r\nstuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition\r\nwhich the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of\r\nearthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to Mr.\r\nSpilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with\r\nhis pocket-money and felt his want of memory for riddles.\r\n\r\n“Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old maid’s\r\nrubbish into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the\r\nauctioneer. “I want to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.”\r\n\r\n“_Im_mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which\r\nyour noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints—Lot 235.\r\nNow, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have a\r\ntreat. Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his\r\nstaff on the Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which\r\nhave, as it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold\r\nto say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political\r\nwinds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our own\r\ntime and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels\r\nmight, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.”\r\n\r\n“Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.\r\n\r\n“It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is not\r\nknown,” answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last\r\nwords, after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion,\r\nas of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or\r\npity, nobody raised the price on him.\r\n\r\nNext came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and\r\nafter he had secured them he went away. Other prints, and afterwards\r\nsome paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a\r\nspecial desire for them, and there was a more active movement of the\r\naudience in and out; some, who had bought what they wanted, going away,\r\nothers coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the\r\nrefreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn. It was\r\nthis marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to\r\nlike looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On\r\nthe last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with\r\nhim a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else,\r\nwhose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a\r\nrelative of the horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His large\r\nwhiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking\r\nfigure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the\r\nprejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much\r\nindulgence as he liked.\r\n\r\n“Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.\r\n\r\n“Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just turned\r\nin from the road.”\r\n\r\nMr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his stick\r\nwith one hand, using his toothpick with the other, and looking about\r\nhim with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on\r\nhim by circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense\r\nrelief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had\r\ndrawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just\r\nbehind the auctioneer. He now came forward again, and his eye caught\r\nthe conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his surprise, was staring at\r\nhim markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by Mr. Trumbull.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoiss_ure_, I\r\nthink. It is some pleasure,” the auctioneer went on with a rising\r\nfervor, “to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and\r\ngentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on\r\na level with his judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school—by\r\nthe celebrated _Guydo_, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of\r\nthe Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to\r\na thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to\r\nthe bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great\r\nmany pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this\r\nmark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family\r\nsubjects. But here is a _Guydo_—the frame alone is worth pounds—which\r\nany lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a\r\nrefectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the\r\nCorporation wished to show his munifi_cence_. Turn it a little, sir?\r\nyes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having\r\nbeen abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, “Five\r\npounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and gentlemen,\r\nfor the credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter\r\nthat a gem of art has been amongst us in this town, and nobody in\r\nMiddlemarch awake to it. Five guineas—five seven-six—five ten. Still,\r\nladies, still! It is a gem, and ‘Full many a gem,’ as the poet says,\r\nhas been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no\r\nbetter, because it was offered in circles where there was—I was going\r\nto say a low feeling, but no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a _Guydo_ of the\r\nfirst order going at six guineas—it is an insult to religion, ladies;\r\nit touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a subject like this\r\nshould go at such a low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”\r\n\r\nThe bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it, remembering\r\nthat Mrs. Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture, and thinking\r\nthat he might stretch the price to twelve pounds. But it was knocked\r\ndown to him at ten guineas, whereupon he pushed his way towards the\r\nbow-window and went out. He chose to go under the marquee to get a\r\nglass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty of other visitors,\r\nand he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water; but\r\nbefore she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid\r\nstranger who had stared at him. It struck Will at this moment that the\r\nman might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated\r\nkind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having\r\nheard him speak on the Reform question, and who might think of getting\r\na shilling by news. In this light his person, already rather heating to\r\nbehold on a summer’s day, appeared the more disagreeable; and Will,\r\nhalf-seated on the elbow of a garden-chair, turned his eyes carefully\r\naway from the comer. But this signified little to our acquaintance Mr.\r\nRaffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling\r\nobservation, if it suited his purpose to do so. He moved a step or two\r\ntill he was in front of Will, and said with full-mouthed haste, “Excuse\r\nme, Mr. Ladislaw—was your mother’s name Sarah Dunkirk?”\r\n\r\nWill, starting to his feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and saying\r\nwith some fierceness, “Yes, sir, it was. And what is that to you?”\r\n\r\nIt was in Will’s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct\r\nanswer of the question and a challenge of the consequences. To have\r\nsaid, “What is that to you?” in the first instance, would have seemed\r\nlike shuffling—as if he minded who knew anything about his origin!\r\n\r\nRaffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which\r\nwas implied in Ladislaw’s threatening air. The slim young fellow with\r\nhis girl’s complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to spring on him.\r\nUnder such circumstances Mr. Raffles’s pleasure in annoying his company\r\nwas kept in abeyance.\r\n\r\n“No offence, my good sir, no offence! I only remember your mother—knew\r\nher when she was a girl. But it is your father that you feature, sir. I\r\nhad the pleasure of seeing your father too. Parents alive, Mr.\r\nLadislaw?”\r\n\r\n“No!” thundered Will, in the same attitude as before.\r\n\r\n“Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw—by Jove, I should!\r\nHope to meet again.”\r\n\r\nHereupon Raffles, who had lifted his hat with the last words, turned\r\nhimself round with a swing of his leg and walked away. Will looked\r\nafter him a moment, and could see that he did not re-enter the\r\nauction-room, but appeared to be walking towards the road. For an\r\ninstant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on\r\ntalking;—but no! on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from\r\nthat source.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, however, Raffles overtook him in the street, and\r\nappearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former\r\nreception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity, greeted\r\nhim jovially and walked by his side, remarking at first on the\r\npleasantness of the town and neighborhood. Will suspected that the man\r\nhad been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when Raffles\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“I’ve been abroad myself, Mr. Ladislaw—I’ve seen the world—used to\r\nparley-vous a little. It was at Boulogne I saw your father—a most\r\nuncommon likeness you are of him, by Jove! mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned\r\noff your brow just like his—a little in the foreign style. John Bull\r\ndoesn’t do much of that. But your father was very ill when I saw him.\r\nLord, lord! hands you might see through. You were a small youngster\r\nthen. Did he get well?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Will, curtly.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Well! I’ve often wondered what became of your mother. She ran away\r\nfrom her friends when she was a young lass—a proud-spirited lass, and\r\npretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she ran away,” said Raffles,\r\nwinking slowly as he looked sideways at Will.\r\n\r\n“You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning on him\r\nrather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive to shades\r\nof manner.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively. “She was a little\r\ntoo honorable to like her friends—that was it!” Here Raffles again\r\nwinked slowly. “Lord bless you, I knew all about ’em—a little in what\r\nyou may call the respectable thieving line—the high style of\r\nreceiving-house—none of your holes and corners—first-rate. Slap-up\r\nshop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord! Sarah would have known\r\nnothing about it—a dashing young lady she was—fine boarding-school—fit\r\nfor a lord’s wife—only Archie Duncan threw it at her out of spite,\r\nbecause she would have nothing to do with him. And so she ran away from\r\nthe whole concern. I travelled for ’em, sir, in a gentlemanly way—at a\r\nhigh salary. They didn’t mind her running away at first—godly folks,\r\nsir, very godly—and she was for the stage. The son was alive then, and\r\nthe daughter was at a discount. Hallo! here we are at the Blue Bull.\r\nWhat do you say, Mr. Ladislaw?—shall we turn in and have a glass?”\r\n\r\n“No, I must say good evening,” said Will, dashing up a passage which\r\nled into Lowick Gate, and almost running to get out of Raffles’s reach.\r\n\r\nHe walked a long while on the Lowick road away from the town, glad of\r\nthe starlit darkness when it came. He felt as if he had had dirt cast\r\non him amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm the fellow’s\r\nstatement—that his mother never would tell him the reason why she had\r\nrun away from her family.\r\n\r\nWell! what was he, Will Ladislaw, the worse, supposing the truth about\r\nthat family to be the ugliest? His mother had braved hardship in order\r\nto separate herself from it. But if Dorothea’s friends had known this\r\nstory—if the Chettams had known it—they would have had a fine color to\r\ngive their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come\r\nnear her. However, let them suspect what they pleased, they would find\r\nthemselves in the wrong. They would find out that the blood in his\r\nveins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n“Inconsistencies,” answered Imlac, “cannot both be right, but imputed\r\nto man they may both be true.”—_Rasselas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to Brassing\r\non business, his good wife met him in the entrance-hall and drew him\r\ninto his private sitting-room.\r\n\r\n“Nicholas,” she said, fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously, “there\r\nhas been such a disagreeable man here asking for you—it has made me\r\nquite uncomfortable.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of man, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully certain of\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n“A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his manner.\r\nHe declared he was an old friend of yours, and said you would be sorry\r\nnot to see him. He wanted to wait for you here, but I told him he could\r\nsee you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most impudent he was!—stared at\r\nme, and said his friend Nick had luck in wives. I don’t believe he\r\nwould have gone away, if Blucher had not happened to break his chain\r\nand come running round on the gravel—for I was in the garden; so I\r\nsaid, ‘You’d better go away—the dog is very fierce, and I can’t hold\r\nhim.’ Do you really know anything of such a man?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I know who he is, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in his usual\r\nsubdued voice, “an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I helped too much\r\nin days gone by. However, I presume you will not be troubled by him\r\nagain. He will probably come to the Bank—to beg, doubtless.”\r\n\r\nNo more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode\r\nhad returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. His wife, not\r\nsure that he was come home, looked into his dressing-room and saw him\r\nwith his coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and\r\nstaring absently at the ground. He started nervously and looked up as\r\nshe entered.\r\n\r\n“You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I have a good deal of pain in my head,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who was so\r\nfrequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe in this\r\ncause of depression.\r\n\r\n“Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.”\r\n\r\nPhysically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the\r\naffectionate attention soothed him. Though always polite, it was his\r\nhabit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his wife’s\r\nduty. But to-day, while she was bending over him, he said, “You are\r\nvery good, Harriet,” in a tone which had something new in it to her\r\near; she did not know exactly what the novelty was, but her woman’s\r\nsolicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he might be going\r\nto have an illness.\r\n\r\n“Has anything worried you?” she said. “Did that man come to you at the\r\nBank?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was as I had supposed. He is a man who at one time might have\r\ndone better. But he has sunk into a drunken debauched creature.”\r\n\r\n“Is he quite gone away?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously; but for\r\ncertain reasons she refrained from adding, “It was very disagreeable to\r\nhear him calling himself a friend of yours.” At that moment she would\r\nnot have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness\r\nthat her husband’s earlier connections were not quite on a level with\r\nher own. Not that she knew much about them. That her husband had at\r\nfirst been employed in a bank, that he had afterwards entered into what\r\nhe called city business and gained a fortune before he was\r\nthree-and-thirty, that he had married a widow who was much older than\r\nhimself—a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous\r\nquality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the\r\ndispassionate judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared\r\nto learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative\r\noccasionally gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination\r\nto be a preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic\r\nefforts. She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a\r\npeculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned\r\nher own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had\r\nbeen the means of raising her own position. But she also liked to think\r\nthat it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand\r\nof Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a\r\nbetter light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or\r\ndissenting chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted\r\nLondon; and while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs.\r\nBulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more\r\nrespectable. She so much wished to ignore towards others that her\r\nhusband had ever been a London Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out\r\nof sight even in talking to him. He was quite aware of this; indeed in\r\nsome respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose\r\nimitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had\r\nnothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a thorough\r\ninclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as belong to a\r\nman who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the loss of high\r\nconsideration from his wife, as from every one else who did not clearly\r\nhate him out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death\r\nto him. When she said—\r\n\r\n“Is he quite gone away?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I trust so,” he answered, with an effort to throw as much sober\r\nunconcern into his tone as possible!\r\n\r\nBut in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust. In\r\nthe interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his\r\neagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed. He\r\nhad frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to\r\nMiddlemarch, just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood\r\nwould suit him to live in. He had certainly had a few debts to pay more\r\nthan he expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a cool\r\nfive-and-twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present. What\r\nhe had wanted chiefly was to see his friend Nick and family, and know\r\nall about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached.\r\nBy-and-by he might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles\r\ndeclined to be “seen off the premises,” as he expressed it—declined to\r\nquit Middlemarch under Bulstrode’s eyes. He meant to go by coach the\r\nnext day—if he chose.\r\n\r\nBulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could\r\navail: he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise. On\r\nthe contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles—unless\r\nprovidence sent death to hinder him—would come back to Middlemarch\r\nbefore long. And that certainty was a terror.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he\r\nwas in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors\r\nand the mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life\r\nwhich would render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the\r\nreligion with which he had diligently associated himself. The terror of\r\nbeing judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over\r\nthat long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in\r\ngeneral phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a\r\nzone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man\r\nto own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened\r\nwound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn\r\npreparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose\r\nfrom the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing\r\nshudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.\r\n\r\nInto this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the\r\npleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,\r\nwithout interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and\r\nfear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his earlier life\r\ncoming between him and everything else, as obstinately as when we look\r\nthrough the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn our backs\r\non are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees. The\r\nsuccessive events inward and outward were there in one view: though\r\neach might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nOnce more he saw himself the young banker’s clerk, with an agreeable\r\nperson, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech and fond of\r\ntheological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic\r\ndissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in\r\nconviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he heard himself called\r\nfor as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious\r\nplatforms, preaching in private houses. Again he felt himself thinking\r\nof the ministry as possibly his vocation, and inclined towards\r\nmissionary labor. That was the happiest time of his life: that was the\r\nspot he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream.\r\nThe people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very\r\nfew, but they were very near to him, and stirred his satisfaction the\r\nmore; his power stretched through a narrow space, but he felt its\r\neffect the more intensely. He believed without effort in the peculiar\r\nwork of grace within him, and in the signs that God intended him for\r\nspecial instrumentality.\r\n\r\nThen came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion\r\nhe had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was\r\ninvited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk, the richest man in\r\nthe congregation. Soon he became an intimate there, honored for his\r\npiety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the husband, whose\r\nwealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the\r\nsetting-in of a new current for his ambition, directing his prospects\r\nof “instrumentality” towards the uniting of distinguished religious\r\ngifts with successful business.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate\r\npartner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill\r\nthe severely felt vacancy as his young friend Bulstrode, if he would\r\nbecome confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business\r\nwas a pawnbroker’s, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and\r\nprofits; and on a short acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware\r\nthat one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any\r\ngoods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But\r\nthere was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess\r\nto give suggestions of shame.\r\n\r\nHe remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private, and\r\nwere filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer.\r\nThe business was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to\r\nset up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old\r\none? The profits made out of lost souls—where can the line be drawn at\r\nwhich they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God’s way of\r\nsaving His chosen? “Thou knowest,”—the young Bulstrode had said then,\r\nas the older Bulstrode was saying now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul\r\nsits from these things—how I view them all as implements for tilling\r\nThy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.”\r\n\r\nMetaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual\r\nexperiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his\r\nposition seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune had\r\nalready opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private. Mr.\r\nDunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he\r\nhad never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of\r\nsalvation. And it was true that Bulstrode found himself carrying on two\r\ndistinct lives; his religious activity could not be incompatible with\r\nhis business as soon as he had argued himself into not feeling it\r\nincompatible.\r\n\r\nMentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same\r\npleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into\r\nintricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral\r\nsensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his\r\nsoul had become more saturated with the belief that he did everything\r\nfor God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own. And yet—if he\r\ncould be back in that far-off spot with his youthful poverty—why, then\r\nhe would choose to be a missionary.\r\n\r\nBut the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on. There\r\nwas trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only\r\ndaughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and\r\nnow the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also.\r\nThe wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of\r\nthe magnificent trade, of which she never knew the precise nature, had\r\ncome to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him as women often\r\nadore their priest or “man-made” minister. It was natural that after a\r\ntime marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.\r\nDunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been\r\nregarded as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the\r\ndaughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The\r\nmother, having lost her boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a\r\ndouble sense to reclaim her daughter. If she were found, there would be\r\na channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in the provision for several\r\ngrandchildren. Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs. Dunkirk\r\nwould marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well\r\nas other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother believed that her\r\ndaughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without\r\nreservation of property.\r\n\r\nThe daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode knew\r\nit, and he was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself away.\r\n\r\nThat was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in the\r\nrigid outline with which acts present themselves to onlookers. But for\r\nhimself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact\r\nwas broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by\r\nreasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode’s course up to\r\nthat time had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences,\r\nappearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best\r\nuse of a large property and withdrawing it from perversion. Death and\r\nother striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come;\r\nand Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these\r\nbare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively small,\r\nbut the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor\r\nof his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to\r\nothers by inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself.\r\nCould it be for God’s service that this fortune should in any\r\nconsiderable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were\r\ngiven up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in\r\ntriviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable\r\nprovidences? Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The\r\ndaughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept\r\nher existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the\r\nmother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman\r\nmight be no more.\r\n\r\nThere were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was\r\nunrighteous; but how could he go back? He had mental exercises, called\r\nhimself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his course of\r\ninstrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen his\r\npath, by taking away his wife. He did gradually withdraw his capital,\r\nbut he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the\r\nbusiness, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it\r\nfinally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred\r\nthousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important—a\r\nbanker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in\r\ntrading concerns, in which his ability was directed to economy in the\r\nraw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk.\r\nAnd now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly\r\nthirty years—when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the\r\nconsciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if with\r\nthe terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something\r\nmomentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his\r\nlongings and terrors. There, he thought, lay an opening towards\r\nspiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him. There may be\r\ncoarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the\r\nsake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He was\r\nsimply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic\r\nbeliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his\r\ndesires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be\r\nhypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all,\r\nto whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future\r\nperfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the\r\nworld; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved\r\nremnant, including ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the\r\nsolidarity of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life\r\nthe ground he alleged to himself for his choice of action: it had been\r\nthe motive which he had poured out in his prayers. Who would use money\r\nand position better than he meant to use them? Who could surpass him in\r\nself-abhorrence and exaltation of God’s cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode\r\nGod’s cause was something distinct from his own rectitude of conduct:\r\nit enforced a discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used\r\nmerely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep\r\nout of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in\r\ntrades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most\r\nactive devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits\r\nin the hands of God’s servant.\r\n\r\nThis implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical\r\nbelief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to\r\nEnglishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating\r\nout our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct\r\nfellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.\r\n\r\nBut a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has\r\nnecessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less adapts\r\nhimself. Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness to God’s\r\ncause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated by use—but\r\nuse me!”—had been the mould into which he had constrained his immense\r\nneed of being something important and predominating. And now had come a\r\nmoment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly\r\ncast away.\r\n\r\nWhat if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a\r\nstronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of\r\nthe scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the\r\nruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had\r\nbrought unclean offerings.\r\n\r\nHe had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a repentance\r\nhad come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence\r\nurged him to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal\r\ntransaction. The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for him;\r\nself-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in\r\nhis hand. It was really before his God that Bulstrode was about to\r\nattempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized\r\nhis susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in\r\nhim a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the resurgent\r\nthreatening past was making a conscience within him, he was thinking by\r\nwhat means he could recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could\r\nstay the rod. His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he\r\nspontaneously did something right, God would save him from the\r\nconsequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the\r\nemotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear\r\nremains nearly at the level of the savage.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this\r\nwas a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread,\r\nbut did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win\r\nprotection. At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter\r\nto Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at the Shrubs that evening for a\r\nprivate interview at nine o’clock. Will had felt no particular surprise\r\nat the request, and connected it with some new notions about the\r\n“Pioneer;” but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he\r\nwas struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was\r\ngoing to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness,\r\nhe only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the\r\npicture bought for her.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters\r\nthis evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because I have a\r\ncommunication of a very private—indeed, I will say, of a sacredly\r\nconfidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare\r\nsay, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been\r\nimportant ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.”\r\n\r\nWill felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state\r\nof keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of\r\nties in the past, and his presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed\r\nlike the fluctuations of a dream—as if the action begun by that loud\r\nbloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking\r\npiece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of\r\nspeech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as their\r\nremembered contrast. He answered, with a marked change of color—\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, nothing.”\r\n\r\n“You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken. But\r\nfor the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the\r\nbar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion\r\nto make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come\r\nhere to-night. So far as human laws go, you have no claim on me\r\nwhatever.”\r\n\r\nWill was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had\r\npaused, leaning his head on his hand, and looking at the floor. But he\r\nnow fixed his examining glance on Will and said—\r\n\r\n“I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran\r\naway from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at\r\none time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these\r\nstatements?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an\r\ninquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to\r\nthe banker’s previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed\r\nthe order of his emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity\r\nfor restitution had come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards\r\nthe penitential expression by which he was deprecating chastisement.\r\n\r\n“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.\r\n\r\n“No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous,\r\nhonorable woman,” said Will, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never mention\r\nher mother to you at all?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the\r\nreason of her running away. She said ‘poor mother’ in a pitying tone.”\r\n\r\n“That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment\r\nbefore he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said\r\nbefore, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I\r\nwas enriched by that marriage—a result which would probably not have\r\ntaken place—certainly not to the same extent—if your grandmother could\r\nhave discovered her daughter. That daughter, I gather, is no longer\r\nliving!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly\r\nwithin him, that without quite knowing what he did, he took his hat\r\nfrom the floor and stood up. The impulse within him was to reject the\r\ndisclosed connection.\r\n\r\n“Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,” said Bulstrode, anxiously. “Doubtless\r\nyou are startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat\r\nyour patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial.”\r\n\r\nWill reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt for\r\nthis voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.\r\n\r\n“It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which\r\nbefell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to\r\nsupply you adequately from a store which would have probably already\r\nbeen yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother’s existence\r\nand been able to find her.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking piece\r\nof scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a penitential act\r\nin the eyes of God. He had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw’s\r\nmind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its\r\nnatural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of\r\ndiscoveries which he would have been glad to conjure back into\r\ndarkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode,\r\nwho at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now raised\r\nthem with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—\r\n\r\n“I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she\r\nmight have been found.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands.\r\nHe was totally unprepared to have his advances met in this way, or to\r\nfind himself urged into more revelation than he had beforehand set down\r\nas needful. But at that moment he dared not tell a lie, and he felt\r\nsuddenly uncertain of his ground which he had trodden with some\r\nconfidence before.\r\n\r\n“I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,” he answered, with a\r\nfaltering in his tone. “And I wish to make atonement to you as the one\r\nstill remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I trust,\r\ninto my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than\r\nmerely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely\r\nindependent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own\r\nresources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you\r\nfive hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a\r\nproportional capital at my death—nay, to do still more, if more should\r\nbe definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.” Mr.\r\nBulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these\r\nwould work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nBut Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip pouting and\r\nhis fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the least touched, and\r\nsaid firmly,—\r\n\r\n“Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg\r\nyou to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business\r\nby which that fortune you speak of was originally made?”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could he\r\nrefuse to answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the question?\r\nHe answered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable one—nay,\r\none that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those\r\nconcerned in it with thieves and convicts?”\r\n\r\nWill’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his question\r\nas nakedly as he could.\r\n\r\nBulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been prepared for a\r\nscene of self-abasement, but his intense pride and his habit of\r\nsupremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man,\r\nwhom he had meant to benefit, turned on him with the air of a judge.\r\n\r\n“The business was established before I became connected with it, sir;\r\nnor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he answered,\r\nnot raising his voice, but speaking with quick defiantness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his hand.\r\n“It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide\r\nwhether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My\r\nunblemished honor is important to me. It is important to me to have no\r\nstain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain\r\nwhich I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried to keep as clear of it\r\nas she could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money. If I\r\nhad any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who\r\ncould disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is\r\nthat you kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie\r\nwith a man’s self that he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was\r\nout of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed\r\nbehind him. He was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion\r\nagainst this inherited blot which had been thrust on his knowledge to\r\nreflect at present whether he had not been too hard on Bulstrode—too\r\narrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at\r\nretrieval when time had rendered them vain.\r\n\r\nNo third person listening could have thoroughly understood the\r\nimpetuosity of Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No one\r\nbut himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of\r\nhis own dignity had an immediate bearing for him on his relation to\r\nDorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of him. And in the rush of\r\nimpulses by which he flung back that offer of Bulstrode’s there was\r\nmingled the sense that it would have been impossible for him ever to\r\ntell Dorothea that he had accepted it.\r\n\r\nAs for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and\r\nwept like a woman. It was the first time he had encountered an open\r\nexpression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that\r\nscorn hurrying like venom through his system, there was no sensibility\r\nleft to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be checked. His\r\nwife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an\r\nOriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard,\r\nin the first instance, the interesting things which they tried to\r\nrepeat to him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most\r\ncomfort was, that Will Ladislaw at least was not likely to publish what\r\nhad taken place that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nHe was a squyer of lowe degre,\r\nThat loved the king’s daughter of Hungrie.\r\n—_Old Romance_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Ladislaw’s mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea again, and\r\nforthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after his agitating scene\r\nwith Bulstrode he wrote a brief letter to her, saying that various\r\ncauses had detained him in the neighborhood longer than he had\r\nexpected, and asking her permission to call again at Lowick at some\r\nhour which she would mention on the earliest possible day, he being\r\nanxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until she had granted him an\r\ninterview. He left the letter at the office, ordering the messenger to\r\ncarry it to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer.\r\n\r\nLadislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. His former\r\nfarewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam, and had\r\nbeen announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly trying to a\r\nman’s dignity to reappear when he is not expected to do so: a first\r\nfarewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an\r\nopening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter\r\nsneers afloat about Will’s motives for lingering. Still it was on the\r\nwhole more satisfactory to his feeling to take the directest means of\r\nseeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of\r\nchance to a meeting of which he wished her to understand that it was\r\nwhat he earnestly sought. When he had parted from her before, he had\r\nbeen in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation\r\nbetween them, and made a more absolute severance than he had then\r\nbelieved in. He knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being\r\nlittle used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that\r\naccording to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw,\r\nwould mean that she consented to be penniless. That was not what he\r\ncould wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready\r\nto meet such hard contrast for his sake. And then, too, there was the\r\nfresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if\r\nknown would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look down\r\nupon him as utterly below her. The secret hope that after some years he\r\nmight come back with the sense that he had at least a personal value\r\nequal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream.\r\nThis change would surely justify him in asking Dorothea to receive him\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothea on that morning was not at home to receive Will’s note. In\r\nconsequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be\r\nat home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news,\r\nmeaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her\r\nuncle had intrusted her—thinking, as he said, “a little mental\r\noccupation of this sort good for a widow.”\r\n\r\nIf Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that\r\nmorning, he would have felt all his suppositions confirmed as to the\r\nreadiness of certain people to sneer at his lingering in the\r\nneighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning\r\nDorothea, had been on the watch to learn Ladislaw’s movements, and had\r\nan instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in his\r\nconfidence on this matter. That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch\r\nnearly two months after he had declared that he was going immediately,\r\nwas a fact to embitter Sir James’s suspicions, or at least to justify\r\nhis aversion to a “young fellow” whom he represented to himself as\r\nslight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as\r\nnaturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a\r\nstrict profession. But he had just heard something from Standish which,\r\nwhile it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of\r\nnullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea.\r\n\r\nUnwonted circumstances may make us all rather unlike ourselves: there\r\nare conditions under which the most majestic person is obliged to\r\nsneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in the same\r\nincongruous manner. Good Sir James was this morning so far unlike\r\nhimself that he was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a\r\nsubject which he usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to\r\nthem both. He could not use Celia as a medium, because he did not\r\nchoose that she should know the kind of gossip he had in his mind; and\r\nbefore Dorothea happened to arrive he had been trying to imagine how,\r\nwith his shyness and unready tongue, he could ever manage to introduce\r\nhis communication. Her unexpected presence brought him to utter\r\nhopelessness in his own power of saying anything unpleasant; but\r\ndesperation suggested a resource; he sent the groom on an unsaddled\r\nhorse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who\r\nalready knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to\r\nrepeat it as often as required.\r\n\r\nDorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom she\r\nwanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and she was\r\nstill talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for\r\nthe rector’s wife, saw her coming and met her with the needful hints.\r\n\r\n“Enough! I understand,”—said Mrs. Cadwallader. “You shall be innocent.\r\nI am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean that it’s of any consequence,” said Sir James, disliking\r\nthat Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. “Only it is desirable\r\nthat Dorothea should know there are reasons why she should not receive\r\nhim again; and I really can’t say so to her. It will come lightly from\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nIt came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to\r\nmeet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the\r\npark by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a\r\nmatronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back?\r\nDelightful!—coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of\r\nParliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the “Pioneer”—somebody\r\nhad prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all\r\ncolors for want of knowing how to help itself, because Mr. Brooke’s\r\nprotege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir James\r\nheard that?\r\n\r\nThe three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning\r\naside to whip a shrub, said he had heard something of that sort.\r\n\r\n“All false!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “He is not gone, or going,\r\napparently; the ‘Pioneer’ keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is\r\nmaking a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr.\r\nLydgate’s wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It\r\nseems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young\r\ngentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in\r\nmanufacturing towns are always disreputable.”\r\n\r\n“You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and I\r\nbelieve this is false too,” said Dorothea, with indignant energy; “at\r\nleast, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil\r\nspoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already suffered too much injustice.”\r\n\r\nDorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her\r\nfeelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held\r\nit petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of\r\nbeing herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.\r\n\r\nSir James, glancing at her, repented of his stratagem; but Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her hands\r\noutward and said—“Heaven grant it, my dear!—I mean that all bad tales\r\nabout anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should\r\nhave married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering he’s a son of\r\nsomebody, he might have got a woman with good blood in her veins, and\r\nnot too young, who would have put up with his profession. There’s Clara\r\nHarfager, for instance, whose friends don’t know what to do with her;\r\nand she has a portion. Then we might have had her among us.\r\nHowever!—it’s no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia? Pray\r\nlet us go in.”\r\n\r\n“I am going on immediately to Tipton,” said Dorothea, rather haughtily.\r\n“Good-by.”\r\n\r\nSir James could say nothing as he accompanied her to the carriage. He\r\nwas altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had\r\ncost him some secret humiliation beforehand.\r\n\r\nDorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn\r\ncorn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and\r\nrolled down her cheeks, but she did not know it. The world, it seemed,\r\nwas turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for her\r\ntrustfulness. “It is not true—it is not true!” was the voice within her\r\nthat she listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which there\r\nhad always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on her\r\nattention—the remembrance of that day when she had found Will Ladislaw\r\nwith Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his voice accompanied by the piano.\r\n\r\n“He said he would never do anything that I disapproved—I wish I could\r\nhave told him that I disapproved of that,” said poor Dorothea,\r\ninwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger with Will and the\r\npassionate defence of him. “They all try to blacken him before me; but\r\nI will care for no pain, if he is not to blame. I always believed he\r\nwas good.”—These were her last thoughts before she felt that the\r\ncarriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange,\r\nwhen she hurriedly pressed her handkerchief to her face and began to\r\nthink of her errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses\r\nfor half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and\r\nDorothea, having the sense that she was going to rest, took off her\r\ngloves and bonnet, while she was leaning against a statue in the\r\nentrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last she said—\r\n\r\n“I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and\r\nwrite you some memoranda from my uncle’s letter, if you will open the\r\nshutters for me.”\r\n\r\n“The shutters are open, madam,” said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who\r\nhad walked along as she spoke. “Mr. Ladislaw is there, looking for\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n(Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his own sketches which he had\r\nmissed in the act of packing his movables, and did not choose to leave\r\nbehind.)\r\n\r\nDorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she\r\nwas not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there\r\nwas for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something\r\nprecious that one has lost. When she reached the door she said to Mrs.\r\nKell—\r\n\r\n“Go in first, and tell him that I am here.”\r\n\r\nWill had found his portfolio, and had laid it on the table at the far\r\nend of the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by\r\nlooking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature\r\ntoo mysterious for Dorothea. He was smiling at it still, and shaking\r\nthe sketches into order with the thought that he might find a letter\r\nfrom her awaiting him at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to his elbow\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.”\r\n\r\nWill turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering.\r\nAs Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her they met: each was looking at\r\nthe other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that\r\nsuppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept them silent, for\r\nthey both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in\r\na sad parting.\r\n\r\nShe moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the\r\nwriting-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her, went a\r\nfew paces off and stood opposite to her.\r\n\r\n“Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap; “I am\r\nvery glad you were here.” Will thought that her face looked just as it\r\ndid when she first shook hands with him in Rome; for her widow’s cap,\r\nfixed in her bonnet, had gone off with it, and he could see that she\r\nhad lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in her\r\nagitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had been used, when\r\nthey were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom\r\nwhich comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s\r\nwords hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take\r\npossession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once\r\nmore—what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its\r\nabsence?\r\n\r\n“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,”\r\nsaid Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going away\r\nimmediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”\r\n\r\n“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you\r\nthought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things\r\nwhich have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before,\r\nI was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever\r\nshall—now.” Will paused here.\r\n\r\n“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking\r\naway from her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I\r\nhave been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.\r\nThere has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to\r\nknow that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under\r\nno circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I\r\nsought money under the pretext of seeking—something else. There was no\r\nneed of other safeguard against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.”\r\n\r\nWill rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew\r\nwhere; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been\r\nopen as now about the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had\r\nstood within it and talked together. Her whole heart was going out at\r\nthis moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to\r\nconvince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to\r\nhave turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any\r\nmeanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead\r\nwith him, she moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old\r\nplace in the window, saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nWhen Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out of the\r\nwindow, without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement\r\nfollowing up the previous anger of his tone. She was ready to say that\r\nit was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless; but those\r\nstrange particulars of their relation which neither of them could\r\nexplicitly mention kept her always in dread of saying too much. At this\r\nmoment she had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to\r\nmarry her, and she feared using words which might imply such a belief.\r\nShe only said earnestly, recurring to his last word—\r\n\r\n“I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”\r\n\r\nWill did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these\r\nwords of hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked pale and\r\nmiserable after his angry outburst. He went to the table and fastened\r\nup his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him from the distance. They\r\nwere wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What\r\ncould he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was\r\nthe passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter? What\r\ncould she say, since she might offer him no help—since she was forced\r\nto keep the money that ought to have been his?—since to-day he seemed\r\nnot to respond as he used to do to her thorough trust and liking?\r\n\r\nBut Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the\r\nwindow again.\r\n\r\n“I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which\r\nsometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and\r\nburned with gazing too close at a light.\r\n\r\n“What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your\r\nintentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as\r\nuninteresting. “I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I\r\nsuppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob.\r\nThen trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we were alike\r\nin speaking too strongly.”\r\n\r\n“I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back against\r\nthe angle of the wall. “There are certain things which a man can only\r\ngo through once in his life; and he must know some time or other that\r\nthe best is over with him. This experience has happened to me while I\r\nam very young—that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care\r\nfor anything else is absolutely forbidden to me—I don’t mean merely by\r\nbeing out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my\r\nreach, by my own pride and honor—by everything I respect myself for. Of\r\ncourse I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a\r\ntrance.”\r\n\r\nWill paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to\r\nmisunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting himself\r\nand offending against his self-approval in speaking to her so plainly;\r\nbut still—it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her that\r\nhe would never woo her. It must be admitted to be a ghostly kind of\r\nwooing.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothea’s mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another\r\nvision than his. The thought that she herself might be what Will most\r\ncared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: the\r\nmemory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and\r\nshrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have\r\nbeen the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had\r\nhad constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that\r\nother relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was\r\nthoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple\r\nfriendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband’s\r\ninjurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily,\r\nwhile images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that\r\nWill was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to\r\nknow that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.\r\n\r\nWill was not surprised at her silence. His mind also was tumultuously\r\nbusy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather wildly that\r\nsomething must happen to hinder their parting—some miracle, clearly\r\nnothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had she any\r\nlove for him?—he could not pretend to himself that he would rather\r\nbelieve her to be without that pain. He could not deny that a secret\r\nlonging for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nNeither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea was\r\nraising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her\r\nfootman came to say—\r\n\r\n“The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.”\r\n\r\n“Presently,” said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, she said, “I have\r\nsome memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing\r\ntowards her. “The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.”\r\n\r\n“You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone,\r\nfeeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak.\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking,\r\nfor her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself. Their\r\neyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in hers there was only\r\nsadness. He turned away and took his portfolio under his arm.\r\n\r\n“I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said Dorothea,\r\nrepressing a rising sob.\r\n\r\n“Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I were\r\nnot in danger of forgetting everything else.”\r\n\r\nHe had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it\r\nimpelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash to\r\nDorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the\r\ndoor—the sense that he was no longer there. She sank into the chair,\r\nand for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were\r\nhurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train\r\nbehind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will\r\nloved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less\r\npermissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from.\r\nThey were parted all the same, but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt\r\nher strength return—she could think of him unrestrainedly. At that\r\nmoment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and\r\nbeing loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had\r\nmelted, and her consciousness had room to expand: her past was come\r\nback to her with larger interpretation. The joy was not the\r\nless—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of the\r\nirrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder\r\nto imagine in any eye or from any lips. He had acted so as to defy\r\nreproach, and make wonder respectful.\r\n\r\nAny one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying\r\nthought within her. Just as when inventive power is working with glad\r\nease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only\r\na cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write\r\nher memoranda. She spoke her last words to the housekeeper in cheerful\r\ntones, and when she seated herself in the carriage her eyes were bright\r\nand her cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. She threw back the\r\nheavy “weepers,” and looked before her, wondering which road Will had\r\ntaken. It was in her nature to be proud that he was blameless, and\r\nthrough all her feelings there ran this vein—“I was right to defend\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon\r\nbeing unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his desk, and\r\nwanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled\r\nalong quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the\r\ndust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the\r\ngreat clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy place\r\nunder the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she might\r\novertake Will and see him once more.\r\n\r\nAfter a turn of the road, there he was with the portfolio under his\r\narm; but the next moment she was passing him while he raised his hat,\r\nand she felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation,\r\nleaving him behind. She could not look back at him. It was as if a\r\ncrowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder, and forced them\r\nalong different paths, taking them farther and farther away from each\r\nother, and making it useless to look back. She could no more make any\r\nsign that would seem to say, “Need we part?” than she could stop the\r\ncarriage to wait for him. Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon her\r\nagainst any movement of her thought towards a future that might reverse\r\nthe decision of this day!\r\n\r\n“I only wish I had known before—I wish he knew—then we could be quite\r\nhappy in thinking of each other, though we are forever parted. And if I\r\ncould but have given him the money, and made things easier for\r\nhim!”—were the longings that came back the most persistently. And yet,\r\nso heavily did the world weigh on her in spite of her independent\r\nenergy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a\r\ndisadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that\r\nunfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the\r\nopinion of every one connected with her. She felt to the full all the\r\nimperativeness of the motives which urged Will’s conduct. How could he\r\ndream of her defying the barrier that her husband had placed between\r\nthem?—how could she ever say to herself that she would defy it?\r\n\r\nWill’s certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much\r\nmore bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to gall him in\r\nhis sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past him while he\r\nfelt himself plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a\r\nworld which in his present temper offered him little that he coveted,\r\nmade his conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the\r\nsustainment of resolve. After all, he had no assurance that she loved\r\nhim: could any man pretend that he was simply glad in such a case to\r\nhave the suffering all on his own side?\r\n\r\nThat evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\nTWO TEMPTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nThese little things are great to little man.—GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?” said\r\nMr. Toller at one of his Christmas dinner-parties, speaking to Mr.\r\nFarebrother on his right hand.\r\n\r\n“Not much, I am sorry to say,” answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry\r\nMr. Toller’s banter about his belief in the new medical light. “I am\r\nout of the way and he is too busy.”\r\n\r\n“Is he? I am glad to hear it,” said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity\r\nand surprise.\r\n\r\n“He gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital,” said Mr.\r\nFarebrother, who had his reasons for continuing the subject: “I hear of\r\nthat from my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often. She says\r\nLydgate is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode’s\r\ninstitution. He is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming\r\nto us.”\r\n\r\n“And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I\r\nsuppose,” said Mr. Toller.\r\n\r\n“Come, Toller, be candid,” said Mr. Farebrother. “You are too clever\r\nnot to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in\r\neverything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very sure\r\nwhat you ought to do. If a man goes a little too far along a new road,\r\nit is usually himself that he harms more than any one else.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him,” said Dr.\r\nMinchin, looking towards Toller, “for he has sent you the cream of\r\nPeacock’s patients.”\r\n\r\n“Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner,” said\r\nMr. Harry Toller, the brewer. “I suppose his relations in the North\r\nback him up.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Mr. Chichely, “else he ought not to have married that\r\nnice girl we were all so fond of. Hang it, one has a grudge against a\r\nman who carries off the prettiest girl in the town.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, by God! and the best too,” said Mr. Standish.\r\n\r\n“My friend Vincy didn’t half like the marriage, I know that,” said Mr.\r\nChichely. “_He_ wouldn’t do much. How the relations on the other side\r\nmay have come down I can’t say.” There was an emphatic kind of\r\nreticence in Mr. Chichely’s manner of speaking.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shouldn’t think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living,”\r\nsaid Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject\r\nwas dropped.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of\r\nLydgate’s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice,\r\nbut he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or\r\nexpectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate’s\r\nmarriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the\r\ndisappointment in his practice. One evening, when he took the pains to\r\ngo to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he\r\nnoticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way\r\nof keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had\r\nanything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his\r\nwork-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain\r\nbiological views; but he had none of those definite things to say or to\r\nshow which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such\r\nas he used himself to insist on, saying that “there must be a systole\r\nand diastole in all inquiry,” and that “a man’s mind must be\r\ncontinually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and\r\nthe horizon of an object-glass.” That evening he seemed to be talking\r\nwidely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long\r\nthey went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond\r\nto give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a\r\nstrange light in his eyes. “He may have been taking an opiate,” was a\r\nthought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or\r\nmedical worries.”\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he\r\nbelieved, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile\r\ncreature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a\r\nlittle too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his\r\nmother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that\r\nHenrietta Noble was in the room. “However, Lydgate fell in love with\r\nher,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very\r\nlittle corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care\r\nabout personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or\r\nfoolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate\r\nshrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his\r\nprivate affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller’s, the\r\nVicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an\r\nopportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to\r\nopen himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there\r\nwas a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the\r\nplea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of\r\nhis being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party\r\nwas thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were\r\npresent; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had\r\npersuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the\r\nFarebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being\r\ntheir particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits,\r\nthough his enjoyment was of a checkered kind—triumph that his mother\r\nshould see Mary’s importance with the chief personages in the party\r\nbeing much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.\r\nFred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the\r\ndays when he had not begun to dread being “bowled out by Farebrother,”\r\nand this terror was still before him. Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest\r\nmatronly bloom, looked at Mary’s little figure, rough wavy hair, and\r\nvisage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying\r\nunsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary’s appearance in\r\nwedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would\r\n“feature” the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was\r\nparticularly bright; being glad, for Fred’s sake, that his friends were\r\ngetting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should\r\nsee how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy\r\nspoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly\r\ngraceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had\r\nnot been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence\r\nof that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure\r\nto betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him. When Lydgate was\r\ntaking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more\r\nthan if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way:\r\nand when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the\r\nroom, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before\r\nwould have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality,\r\nhowever, she was intensely aware of Lydgate’s voice and movements; and\r\nher pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation\r\nby which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise\r\nof propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate\r\nhad been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond\r\nhappened to be near her, said—“You have to give up a great deal of your\r\nhusband’s society, Mrs. Lydgate.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he is\r\nso devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,” said Rosamond, who was\r\nstanding, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n“It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company,” said Mrs.\r\nVincy, who was seated at the old lady’s side. “I am sure I thought so\r\nwhen Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with her. You know, Mrs.\r\nFarebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition\r\nmyself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is\r\nwhat Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at\r\nodd hours, and never knowing when he will come home, and of a close,\r\nproud disposition, _I_ think”—indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her tone\r\nslightly with this parenthesis. “But Rosamond always had an angel of a\r\ntemper; her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was\r\nnever the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as\r\ngood, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all\r\ngood-tempered, thank God.”\r\n\r\nThis was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw\r\nback her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls,\r\naged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged\r\nto include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to\r\nmake her tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale\r\nof Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was\r\nnever tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite\r\nred volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy’s darling, now ran to her with wide-eyed\r\nserious excitement, crying, “Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so\r\nhard on the floor he couldn’t get his leg out again!”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, my cherub!” said mamma; “you shall tell me all about it\r\nto-morrow. Go and listen!” and then, as her eyes followed Louisa back\r\ntowards the attractive corner, she thought that if Fred wished her to\r\ninvite Mary again she would make no objection, the children being so\r\npleased with her.\r\n\r\nBut presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr.\r\nFarebrother came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her on his\r\nlap; whereupon the girls all insisted that he must hear\r\nRumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell it over again. He insisted too, and\r\nMary, without fuss, began again in her neat fashion, with precisely the\r\nsame words as before. Fred, who had also seated himself near, would\r\nhave felt unmixed triumph in Mary’s effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother\r\nhad not been looking at her with evident admiration, while he\r\ndramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.\r\n\r\n“You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,” said Fred\r\nat the end.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I shall. Tell about him now,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Mary; “ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants\r\nwhose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom, and he\r\nthought they didn’t mind because he couldn’t hear them cry, or see them\r\nuse their pocket-handkerchiefs.”\r\n\r\n“Please,” said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I am a grave old parson. If I try to draw a story out of my\r\nbag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?” said he,\r\nputting on his short-sighted glasses, and pursing up his lips.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Louisa, falteringly.\r\n\r\n“Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially\r\nif they are sweet and have plums in them.”\r\n\r\nLouisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar’s\r\nknee to go to Fred.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year’s Day,” said Mr.\r\nFarebrother, rising and walking away. He had discovered of late that\r\nFred had become jealous of him, and also that he himself was not losing\r\nhis preference for Mary above all other women.\r\n\r\n“A delightful young person is Miss Garth,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who\r\nhad been watching her son’s movements.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to her\r\nexpectantly. “It is a pity she is not better-looking.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say that,” said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. “I like her\r\ncountenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has\r\nseen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good\r\nmanners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any\r\nstation.”\r\n\r\nThe old lady was a little sharp in her tone, having a prospective\r\nreference to Mary’s becoming her daughter-in-law; for there was this\r\ninconvenience in Mary’s position with regard to Fred, that it was not\r\nsuitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick\r\nParsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth.\r\n\r\nNew visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music and\r\ngames, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other\r\nside of the hall. Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy his\r\nmother, who regarded her occasional whist as a protest against scandal\r\nand novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had its dignity.\r\nBut at the end he got Mr. Chichely to take his place, and left the\r\nroom. As he crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking\r\noff his great-coat.\r\n\r\n“You are the man I was going to look for,” said the Vicar; and instead\r\nof entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood\r\nagainst the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing\r\nbank. “You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,” he went on,\r\nsmiling at Lydgate, “now I don’t play for money. I owe that to you,\r\nMrs. Casaubon says.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Lydgate, coldly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you didn’t mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.\r\nYou should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done\r\nhim a good turn. I don’t enter into some people’s dislike of being\r\nunder an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation\r\nto everybody for behaving well to me.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell what you mean,” said Lydgate, “unless it is that I once\r\nspoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon. But I did not think that she would break\r\nher promise not to mention that I had done so,” said Lydgate, leaning\r\nhis back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no\r\nradiance in his face.\r\n\r\n“It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. He paid me the\r\ncompliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living though you\r\nhad come across his tactics, and had praised me up as a Ken and a\r\nTillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Casaubon would hear of no\r\none else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool,” said Lydgate, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was glad of the leakiness then. I don’t see why you shouldn’t\r\nlike me to know that you wished to do me a service, my dear fellow. And\r\nyou certainly have done me one. It’s rather a strong check to one’s\r\nself-complacency to find how much of one’s right doing depends on not\r\nbeing in want of money. A man will not be tempted to say the Lord’s\r\nPrayer backward to please the devil, if he doesn’t want the devil’s\r\nservices. I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see that there’s any money-getting without chance,” said\r\nLydgate; “if a man gets it in a profession, it’s pretty sure to come by\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother thought he could account for this speech, in striking\r\ncontrast with Lydgate’s former way of talking, as the perversity which\r\nwill often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease in his\r\naffairs. He answered in a tone of good-humored admission—\r\n\r\n“Ah, there’s enormous patience wanted with the way of the world. But it\r\nis the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends who love\r\nhim, and ask for nothing better than to help him through, so far as it\r\nlies in their power.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his attitude and\r\nlooking at his watch. “People make much more of their difficulties than\r\nthey need to do.”\r\n\r\nHe knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help to\r\nhimself from Mr. Farebrother, and he could not bear it. So strangely\r\ndetermined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with\r\nthe sense that he had privately done the Vicar a service, the\r\nsuggestion that the Vicar discerned his need of a service in return\r\nmade him shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all\r\nmaking of such offers what else must come?—that he should “mention his\r\ncase,” imply that he wanted specific things. At that moment, suicide\r\nseemed easier.\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that\r\nreply, and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate’s manner and\r\ntone, corresponding with his physique, which if he repelled your\r\nadvances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“What time are you?” said the Vicar, devouring his wounded feeling.\r\n\r\n“After eleven,” said Lydgate. And they went into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too.\r\n\r\n2_d Gent_. Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright\r\n    The coming pest with border fortresses,\r\n    Or catch your carp with subtle argument.\r\n    All force is twain in one: cause is not cause\r\n    Unless effect be there; and action’s self\r\n    Must needs contain a passive. So command\r\n    Exists but with obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if Lydgate had been inclined to be quite open about his affairs,\r\nhe knew that it would have hardly been in Mr. Farebrother’s power to\r\ngive him the help he immediately wanted. With the year’s bills coming\r\nin from his tradesmen, with Dover’s threatening hold on his furniture,\r\nand with nothing to depend on but slow dribbling payments from patients\r\nwho must not be offended—for the handsome fees he had had from Freshitt\r\nHall and Lowick Manor had been easily absorbed—nothing less than a\r\nthousand pounds would have freed him from actual embarrassment, and\r\nleft a residue which, according to the favorite phrase of hopefulness\r\nin such circumstances, would have given him “time to look about him.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, the merry Christmas bringing the happy New Year, when\r\nfellow-citizens expect to be paid for the trouble and goods they have\r\nsmilingly bestowed on their neighbors, had so tightened the pressure of\r\nsordid cares on Lydgate’s mind that it was hardly possible for him to\r\nthink unbrokenly of any other subject, even the most habitual and\r\nsoliciting. He was not an ill-tempered man; his intellectual activity,\r\nthe ardent kindness of his heart, as well as his strong frame, would\r\nalways, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept him above the petty\r\nuncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper. But he was now a\r\nprey to that worst irritation which arises not simply from annoyances,\r\nbut from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances, of\r\nwasted energy and a degrading preoccupation, which was the reverse of\r\nall his former purposes. “_This_ is what I am thinking of; and _that_\r\nis what I might have been thinking of,” was the bitter incessant murmur\r\nwithin him, making every difficulty a double goad to impatience.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general\r\ndiscontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which their\r\ngreat souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self\r\nand an insignificant world may have its consolations. Lydgate’s\r\ndiscontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a\r\ngrand existence in thought and effective action lying around him, while\r\nhis self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic\r\nfears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears. His\r\ntroubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the\r\nattention of lofty persons who can know nothing of debt except on a\r\nmagnificent scale. Doubtless they were sordid; and for the majority,\r\nwho are not lofty, there is no escape from sordidness but by being free\r\nfrom money-craving, with all its base hopes and temptations, its\r\nwatching for death, its hinted requests, its horse-dealer’s desire to\r\nmake bad work pass for good, its seeking for function which ought to be\r\nanother’s, its compulsion often to long for Luck in the shape of a wide\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nIt was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his neck\r\nbeneath this vile yoke that he had fallen into a bitter moody state\r\nwhich was continually widening Rosamond’s alienation from him. After\r\nthe first disclosure about the bill of sale, he had made many efforts\r\nto draw her into sympathy with him about possible measures for\r\nnarrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of\r\nChristmas his propositions grew more and more definite. “We two can do\r\nwith only one servant, and live on very little,” he said, “and I shall\r\nmanage with one horse.” For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to\r\nreason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and\r\nany share of pride he had given to appearances of that sort was meagre\r\ncompared with the pride which made him revolt from exposure as a\r\ndebtor, or from asking men to help him with their money.\r\n\r\n“Of course you can dismiss the other two servants, if you like,” said\r\nRosamond; “but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your\r\nposition for us to live in a poor way. You must expect your practice to\r\nbe lowered.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Rosamond, it is not a question of choice. We have begun too\r\nexpensively. Peacock, you know, lived in a much smaller house than\r\nthis. It is my fault: I ought to have known better, and I deserve a\r\nthrashing—if there were anybody who had a right to give it me—for\r\nbringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have\r\nbeen used to. But we married because we loved each other, I suppose.\r\nAnd that may help us to pull along till things get better. Come, dear,\r\nput down that work and come to me.”\r\n\r\nHe was really in chill gloom about her at that moment, but he dreaded a\r\nfuture without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of\r\ndivision between them. Rosamond obeyed him, and he took her on his\r\nknee, but in her secret soul she was utterly aloof from him. The poor\r\nthing saw only that the world was not ordered to her liking, and\r\nLydgate was part of that world. But he held her waist with one hand and\r\nlaid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man had\r\nmuch tenderness in his manners towards women, seeming to have always\r\npresent in his imagination the weakness of their frames and the\r\ndelicate poise of their health both in body and mind. And he began\r\nagain to speak persuasively.\r\n\r\n“I find, now I look into things a little, Rosy, that it is wonderful\r\nwhat an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping. I suppose the\r\nservants are careless, and we have had a great many people coming. But\r\nthere must be many in our rank who manage with much less: they must do\r\nwith commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems,\r\nmoney goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything\r\nas plain as possible, and he has a very large practice.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!” said Rosamond, with a\r\nlittle turn of her neck. “But I have heard you express your disgust at\r\nthat way of living.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they have bad taste in everything—they make economy look ugly. We\r\nneedn’t do that. I only meant that they avoid expenses, although Wrench\r\nhas a capital practice.”\r\n\r\n“Why should not you have a good practice, Tertius? Mr. Peacock had. You\r\nshould be more careful not to offend people, and you should send out\r\nmedicines as the others do. I am sure you began well, and you got\r\nseveral good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should think\r\nwhat will be generally liked,” said Rosamond, in a decided little tone\r\nof admonition.\r\n\r\nLydgate’s anger rose: he was prepared to be indulgent towards feminine\r\nweakness, but not towards feminine dictation. The shallowness of a\r\nwaternixie’s soul may have a charm until she becomes didactic. But he\r\ncontrolled himself, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness—\r\n\r\n“What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is\r\nnot the question between us. It is enough for you to know that our\r\nincome is likely to be a very narrow one—hardly four hundred, perhaps\r\nless, for a long time to come, and we must try to re-arrange our lives\r\nin accordance with that fact.”\r\n\r\nRosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before her, and then\r\nsaid, “My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you\r\ngive to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“It was understood from the beginning that my services would be\r\ngratuitous. That, again, need not enter into our discussion. I have\r\npointed out what is the only probability,” said Lydgate, impatiently.\r\nThen checking himself, he went on more quietly—\r\n\r\n“I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the\r\npresent difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be\r\nmarried to Miss Sophy Toller. They are rich, and it is not often that a\r\ngood house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that they would be\r\nglad to take this house from us with most of our furniture, and they\r\nwould be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ Trumbull\r\nto speak to Plymdale about it.”\r\n\r\nRosamond left her husband’s knee and walked slowly to the other end of\r\nthe room; when she turned round and walked towards him it was evident\r\nthat the tears had come, and that she was biting her under-lip and\r\nclasping her hands to keep herself from crying. Lydgate was\r\nwretched—shaken with anger and yet feeling that it would be unmanly to\r\nvent the anger just now.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.”\r\n\r\n“I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have\r\nthat man taking an inventory of the furniture—I should have thought\r\n_that_ would suffice.”\r\n\r\n“I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was only a security and\r\nbehind that security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid within\r\nthe next few months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If young\r\nPlymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall be\r\nable to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a\r\nplace too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I\r\nknow, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is\r\nninety.” Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with\r\nwhich we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts.\r\nTears rolled silently down Rosamond’s cheeks; she just pressed her\r\nhandkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the\r\nmantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she had\r\never felt before. At last she said, without hurry and with careful\r\nemphasis—\r\n\r\n“I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Like it?” burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his\r\nhands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; “it’s not a\r\nquestion of liking. Of course, I don’t like it; it’s the only thing I\r\ncan do.” He wheeled round there, and turned towards her.\r\n\r\n“I should have thought there were many other means than that,” said\r\nRosamond. “Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether.”\r\n\r\n“To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go\r\nwhere I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we are\r\nhere,” said Lydgate still more angrily.\r\n\r\n“If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing,\r\nTertius,” said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest\r\nconviction. “You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family.\r\nYou offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we\r\nwere at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him\r\nand told him your affairs, he would do anything for you. But rather\r\nthan that, you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned\r\nPlymdale.”\r\n\r\nThere was something like fierceness in Lydgate’s eyes, as he answered\r\nwith new violence, “Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I\r\nadmit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to\r\nbeg where it’s of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to\r\ndo._”\r\n\r\nThere was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the\r\nclutch of his strong hand on Rosamond’s delicate arm. But for all that,\r\nhis will was not a whit stronger than hers. She immediately walked out\r\nof the room in silence, but with an intense determination to hinder\r\nwhat Lydgate liked to do.\r\n\r\nHe went out of the house, but as his blood cooled he felt that the\r\nchief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him at the\r\nidea of opening with his wife in future subjects which might again urge\r\nhim to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had\r\nbegun, and he was afraid of any movement that might make it fatal. His\r\nmarriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on\r\nloving each other. He had long ago made up his mind to what he thought\r\nwas her negative character—her want of sensibility, which showed itself\r\nin disregard both of his specific wishes and of his general aims. The\r\nfirst great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and\r\ndocile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be\r\ntaken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost\r\ntheir limbs. But the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a\r\nhold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should\r\nremain strong. In marriage, the certainty, “She will never love me\r\nmuch,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I shall love her no more.”\r\nHence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse\r\nher, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.\r\nHe tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made in\r\nthe morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or\r\nsulky; indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and\r\nwas under control. But this was something quite distinct from loving\r\n_him_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of\r\nparting with the house; he was resolved to carry it out, and say as\r\nlittle more about it as possible. But Rosamond herself touched on it at\r\nbreakfast by saying, mildly—\r\n\r\n“Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lydgate, “but I shall call on him as I go by this morning.\r\nNo time must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she\r\nwithdrew her inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he\r\ngot up to go away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs.\r\nPlymdale, Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations\r\ninto the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale’s maternal view\r\nwas, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of\r\nher own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the\r\nside of her son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could\r\ndesire in a daughter-in-law. Of course her father is able to do\r\nsomething handsome for her—that is only what would be expected with a\r\nbrewery like his. And the connection is everything we should desire.\r\nBut that is not what I look at. She is such a very nice girl—no airs,\r\nno pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don’t mean with the\r\ntitled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of\r\ntheir own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town,\r\nand she is contented with that.”\r\n\r\n“I have always thought her very agreeable,” said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n“I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high,\r\nthat he should have got into the very best connection,” continued Mrs.\r\nPlymdale, her native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she was\r\ntaking a correct view. “And such particular people as the Tollers are,\r\nthey might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs. It\r\nis well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from\r\nour youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side.\r\nAnd I myself prefer serious opinions. But the Tollers have welcomed Ned\r\nall the same.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure he is a very deserving, well-principled young man,” said\r\nRosamond, with a neat air of patronage in return for Mrs. Plymdale’s\r\nwholesome corrections.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of\r\ncarriage as if everybody was beneath him, or that showy kind of\r\ntalking, and singing, and intellectual talent. But I am thankful he has\r\nnot. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,” said\r\nRosamond. “I think there is every prospect of their being a happy\r\ncouple. What house will they take?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for that, they must put up with what they can get. They have\r\nbeen looking at the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s;\r\nit belongs to him, and he is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose\r\nthey are not likely to hear of a better. Indeed, I think Ned will\r\ndecide the matter to-day.”\r\n\r\n“I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter’s Place.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows\r\nare narrow, and it is all ups and downs. You don’t happen to know of\r\nany other that would be at liberty?” said Mrs. Plymdale, fixing her\r\nround black eyes on Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Oh no; I hear so little of those things.”\r\n\r\nRosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to\r\npay her visit; she had simply meant to gather any information which\r\nwould help her to avert the parting with her own house under\r\ncircumstances thoroughly disagreeable to her. As to the untruth in her\r\nreply, she no more reflected on it than she did on the untruth there\r\nwas in her saying that appearances had very little to do with\r\nhappiness. Her object, she was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable:\r\nit was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in\r\nher mind which, when she had carried it out fully, would prove how very\r\nfalse a step it would have been for him to have descended from his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nShe returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull’s office, meaning to call\r\nthere. It was the first time in her life that Rosamond had thought of\r\ndoing anything in the form of business, but she felt equal to the\r\noccasion. That she should be obliged to do what she intensely disliked,\r\nwas an idea which turned her quiet tenacity into active invention. Here\r\nwas a case in which it could not be enough simply to disobey and be\r\nserenely, placidly obstinate: she must act according to her judgment,\r\nand she said to herself that her judgment was right—“indeed, if it had\r\nnot been, she would not have wished to act on it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull was in the back-room of his office, and received Rosamond\r\nwith his finest manners, not only because he had much sensibility to\r\nher charms, but because the good-natured fibre in him was stirred by\r\nhis certainty that Lydgate was in difficulties, and that this\r\nuncommonly pretty woman—this young lady with the highest personal\r\nattractions—was likely to feel the pinch of trouble—to find herself\r\ninvolved in circumstances beyond her control. He begged her to do him\r\nthe honor to take a seat, and stood before her trimming and comporting\r\nhimself with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent.\r\nRosamond’s first question was, whether her husband had called on Mr.\r\nTrumbull that morning, to speak about disposing of their house.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am, yes, he did; he did so,” said the good auctioneer, trying\r\nto throw something soothing into his iteration. “I was about to fulfil\r\nhis order, if possible, this afternoon. He wished me not to\r\nprocrastinate.”\r\n\r\n“I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of\r\nyou not to mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I will, Mrs. Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with\r\nme on business or any other topic. I am then to consider the commission\r\nwithdrawn?” said Mr. Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of his blue\r\ncravat with both hands, and looking at Rosamond deferentially.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you please. I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house—the\r\none in St. Peter’s Place next to Mr. Hackbutt’s. Mr. Lydgate would be\r\nannoyed that his orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides\r\nthat, there are other circumstances which render the proposal\r\nunnecessary.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever\r\nyou require any service of me,” said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in\r\nconjecturing that some new resources had been opened. “Rely on me, I\r\nbeg. The affair shall go no further.”\r\n\r\nThat evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond\r\nwas more lively than she had usually been of late, and even seemed\r\ninterested in doing what would please him without being asked. He\r\nthought, “If she will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all\r\nsignify? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long\r\njourney. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do.”\r\n\r\nHe was so much cheered that he began to search for an account of\r\nexperiments which he had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected\r\nout of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty\r\nanxieties. He felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a\r\nfar-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was\r\nas helpful to his meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening\r\nlake. It was rather late; he had pushed away all the books, and was\r\nlooking at the fire with his hands clasped behind his head in\r\nforgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new\r\ncontrolling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was\r\nleaning back in her chair watching him, said—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.”\r\n\r\nLydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a\r\nman who has been disturbed in his sleep. Then flushing with an\r\nunpleasant consciousness, he asked—\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I called at Mrs. Plymdale’s this morning, and she told me that he had\r\ntaken the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was silent. He drew his hands from behind his head and pressed\r\nthem against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass\r\non his forehead, while he rested his elbows on his knees. He was\r\nfeeling bitter disappointment, as if he had opened a door out of a\r\nsuffocating place and had found it walled up; but he also felt sure\r\nthat Rosamond was pleased with the cause of his disappointment. He\r\npreferred not looking at her and not speaking, until he had got over\r\nthe first spasm of vexation. After all, he said in his bitterness, what\r\ncan a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband\r\nwithout them is an absurdity. When he looked up and pushed his hair\r\naside, his dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy\r\nin them, but he only said, coolly—\r\n\r\n“Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the\r\nlook-out if he failed with Plymdale.”\r\n\r\nRosamond made no remark. She trusted to the chance that nothing more\r\nwould pass between her husband and the auctioneer until some issue\r\nshould have justified her interference; at any rate, she had hindered\r\nthe event which she immediately dreaded. After a pause, she said—\r\n\r\n“How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?”\r\n\r\n“What disagreeable people?”\r\n\r\n“Those who took the list—and the others. I mean, how much money would\r\nsatisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?”\r\n\r\nLydgate surveyed her for a moment, as if he were looking for symptoms,\r\nand then said, “Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for\r\nfurniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off\r\nDover, and given enough on account to the others to make them wait\r\npatiently, if we contracted our expenses.”\r\n\r\n“But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?”\r\n\r\n“More than I am likely to get anywhere,” said Lydgate, with rather a\r\ngrating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond’s\r\nmind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n“Why should you not mention the sum?” said Rosamond, with a mild\r\nindication that she did not like his manners.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a\r\nthousand to set me at ease. But,” he added, incisively, “I have to\r\nconsider what I shall do without it, not with it.”\r\n\r\nRosamond said no more.\r\n\r\nBut the next day she carried out her plan of writing to Sir Godwin\r\nLydgate. Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him,\r\nand also one from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her\r\non the loss of her baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they\r\nshould see her again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told her that this\r\npoliteness meant nothing; but she was secretly convinced that any\r\nbackwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him was due to his cold and\r\ncontemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters in her most\r\ncharming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation\r\nwould follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently\r\nwas not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might\r\nhave been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends\r\nat home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the\r\nchin, and pronounced her to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly,\r\nwho had made a conquest of him in 1790, would be touched by any appeal\r\nfrom her, and would find it pleasant for her sake to behave as he ought\r\nto do towards his nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old\r\ngentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering annoyance. And she\r\nwrote what she considered the most judicious letter possible—one which\r\nwould strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent sense—pointing out\r\nhow desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as\r\nMiddlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant\r\ncharacter of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and\r\nhow in consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would\r\nrequire a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him. She did not say\r\nthat Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the\r\nidea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance\r\nwith what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the\r\nrelative who had always been his best friend. Such was the force of\r\nPoor Rosamond’s tactics now she applied them to affairs.\r\n\r\nThis had happened before the party on New Year’s Day, and no answer had\r\nyet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had to\r\nlearn that Rosamond had revoked his order to Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling\r\nit necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of\r\ntheir quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to\r\nspeak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise\r\nthe house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were\r\nadvertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not\r\notherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many people\r\ngo on in their old houses when their families are too large for them,\r\nfor want of knowing where they can find another. And Trumbull seems to\r\nhave got no bite at all.”\r\n\r\nRosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. “I ordered Trumbull\r\nnot to inquire further,” she said, with a careful calmness which was\r\nevidently defensive.\r\n\r\nLydgate stared at her in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he\r\nhad been fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little\r\nlanguage” of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it,\r\naccepted as if she had been a serene and lovely image, now and then\r\nmiraculously dimpling towards her votary. With such fibres still astir\r\nin him, the shock he received could not at once be distinctly anger; it\r\nwas confused pain. He laid down the knife and fork with which he was\r\ncarving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at last, with a\r\ncool irony in his tone—\r\n\r\n“May I ask when and why you did so?”\r\n\r\n“When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him\r\nnot to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let\r\nthe affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to\r\nyou if it were known that you wished to part with your house and\r\nfurniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was\r\nreason enough.”\r\n\r\n“It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons\r\nof another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different\r\nconclusion, and given an order accordingly?” said Lydgate, bitingly,\r\nthe thunder and lightning gathering about his brow and eyes.\r\n\r\nThe effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her\r\nshrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in\r\nthe conviction that she was not the person to misbehave whatever others\r\nmight do. She replied—\r\n\r\n“I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me\r\nat least as much as you.”\r\n\r\n“Clearly—you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right to\r\ncontradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool,” said\r\nLydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, “Is it\r\npossible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of\r\nany use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary for you to tell me again,” said Rosamond, in a\r\nvoice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. “I remembered what\r\nyou said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not\r\nalter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than\r\ntake a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house,\r\nI think it would be perfectly degrading to you.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?”\r\n\r\n“You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me before\r\nwe were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather\r\nthan give up your own will.”\r\n\r\nLydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched\r\nthe corners of his mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he was not\r\nlooking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took\r\nno notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument,\r\noccasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and\r\nrubbing his hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and\r\nthoughts in him that would not let him either give thorough way to his\r\nanger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took\r\nadvantage of his silence.\r\n\r\n“When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high. I\r\ncould not have imagined then that you would want to sell our furniture,\r\nand take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we\r\nare to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch.”\r\n\r\n“These would be very strong considerations,” said Lydgate, half\r\nironically—still there was a withered paleness about his lips as he\r\nlooked at his coffee, and did not drink—“these would be very strong\r\nconsiderations if I did not happen to be in debt.”\r\n\r\n“Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are\r\nrespectable, people trust them. I am sure I have heard papa say that\r\nthe Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well. It cannot be good\r\nto act rashly,” said Rosamond, with serene wisdom.\r\n\r\nLydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning he could\r\napply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer her assent, he wanted to\r\nsmash and grind some object on which he could at least produce an\r\nimpression, or else to tell her brutally that he was master, and she\r\nmust obey. But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on\r\ntheir mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive\r\nobstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final;\r\nand again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying\r\nthat she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying\r\nhim. As to saying that he was master, it was not the fact. The very\r\nresolution to which he had wrought himself by dint of logic and\r\nhonorable pride was beginning to relax under her torpedo contact. He\r\nswallowed half his cup of coffee, and then rose to go.\r\n\r\n“I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at\r\npresent—until it has been seen that there are no other means,” said\r\nRosamond. Although she was not subject to much fear, she felt it safer\r\nnot to betray that she had written to Sir Godwin. “Promise me that you\r\nwill not go to him for a few weeks, or without telling me.”\r\n\r\nLydgate gave a short laugh. “I think it is I who should exact a promise\r\nthat you will do nothing without telling me,” he said, turning his eyes\r\nsharply upon her, and then moving to the door.\r\n\r\n“You remember that we are going to dine at papa’s,” said Rosamond,\r\nwishing that he should turn and make a more thorough concession to her.\r\nBut he only said “Oh yes,” impatiently, and went away. She held it to\r\nbe very odious in him that he did not think the painful propositions he\r\nhad had to make to her were enough, without showing so unpleasant a\r\ntemper. And when she put the moderate request that he would defer going\r\nto Trumbull again, it was cruel in him not to assure her of what he\r\nmeant to do. She was convinced of her having acted in every way for the\r\nbest; and each grating or angry speech of Lydgate’s served only as an\r\naddition to the register of offences in her mind. Poor Rosamond for\r\nmonths had begun to associate her husband with feelings of\r\ndisappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had\r\nlost its charm of encouraging delightful dreams. It had freed her from\r\nthe disagreeables of her father’s house, but it had not given her\r\neverything that she had wished and hoped. The Lydgate with whom she had\r\nbeen in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which\r\nhad disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details\r\nwhich must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated\r\nthrough with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. The habits of\r\nLydgate’s profession, his home preoccupation with scientific subjects,\r\nwhich seemed to her almost like a morbid vampire’s taste, his peculiar\r\nviews of things which had never entered into the dialogue of\r\ncourtship—all these continually alienating influences, even without the\r\nfact of his having placed himself at a disadvantage in the town, and\r\nwithout that first shock of revelation about Dover’s debt, would have\r\nmade his presence dull to her. There was another presence which ever\r\nsince the early days of her marriage, until four months ago, had been\r\nan agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess\r\nto herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her utter\r\nennui; and it seemed to her (perhaps she was right) that an invitation\r\nto Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in\r\nMiddlemarch—in London, or somewhere likely to be free from\r\nunpleasantness—would satisfy her quite well, and make her indifferent\r\nto the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she felt some resentment\r\nfor his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon.\r\n\r\nThat was the state of things with Lydgate and Rosamond on the New\r\nYear’s Day when they dined at her father’s, she looking mildly neutral\r\ntowards him in remembrance of his ill-tempered behavior at breakfast,\r\nand he carrying a much deeper effect from the inward conflict in which\r\nthat morning scene was only one of many epochs. His flushed effort\r\nwhile talking to Mr. Farebrother—his effort after the cynical pretence\r\nthat all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that\r\nchance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool’s illusion—was but\r\nthe symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old\r\nstimuli of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? He saw even more keenly than Rosamond did the\r\ndreariness of taking her into the small house in Bride Street, where\r\nshe would have scanty furniture around her and discontent within: a\r\nlife of privation and life with Rosamond were two images which had\r\nbecome more and more irreconcilable ever since the threat of privation\r\nhad disclosed itself. But even if his resolves had forced the two\r\nimages into combination, the useful preliminaries to that hard change\r\nwere not visibly within reach. And though he had not given the promise\r\nwhich his wife had asked for, he did not go again to Trumbull. He even\r\nbegan to think of taking a rapid journey to the North and seeing Sir\r\nGodwin. He had once believed that nothing would urge him into making an\r\napplication for money to his uncle, but he had not then known the full\r\npressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable. He could not depend on\r\nthe effect of a letter; it was only in an interview, however\r\ndisagreeable this might be to himself, that he could give a thorough\r\nexplanation and could test the effectiveness of kinship. No sooner had\r\nLydgate begun to represent this step to himself as the easiest than\r\nthere was a reaction of anger that he—he who had long ago determined to\r\nlive aloof from such abject calculations, such self-interested anxiety\r\nabout the inclinations and the pockets of men with whom he had been\r\nproud to have no aims in common—should have fallen not simply to their\r\nlevel, but to the level of soliciting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nOne of us two must bowen douteless,\r\nAnd, sith a man is more reasonable\r\nThan woman is, ye [men] moste be suffrable.\r\n—CHAUCER: _Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even\r\nover the present quickening in the general pace of things: what wonder\r\nthen that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to write a letter\r\nwhich was of consequence to others rather than to himself? Nearly three\r\nweeks of the new year were gone, and Rosamond, awaiting an answer to\r\nher winning appeal, was every day disappointed. Lydgate, in total\r\nignorance of her expectations, was seeing the bills come in, and\r\nfeeling that Dover’s use of his advantage over other creditors was\r\nimminent. He had never mentioned to Rosamond his brooding purpose of\r\ngoing to Quallingham: he did not want to admit what would appear to her\r\na concession to her wishes after indignant refusal, until the last\r\nmoment; but he was really expecting to set off soon. A slice of the\r\nrailway would enable him to manage the whole journey and back in four\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBut one morning after Lydgate had gone out, a letter came addressed to\r\nhim, which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin. She was full of\r\nhope. Perhaps there might be a particular note to her enclosed; but\r\nLydgate was naturally addressed on the question of money or other aid,\r\nand the fact that he was written to, nay, the very delay in writing at\r\nall, seemed to certify that the answer was thoroughly compliant. She\r\nwas too much excited by these thoughts to do anything but light\r\nstitching in a warm corner of the dining-room, with the outside of this\r\nmomentous letter lying on the table before her. About twelve she heard\r\nher husband’s step in the passage, and tripping to open the door, she\r\nsaid in her lightest tones, “Tertius, come in here—here is a letter for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?” he said, not taking off his hat, but just turning her round\r\nwithin his arm to walk towards the spot where the letter lay. “My uncle\r\nGodwin!” he exclaimed, while Rosamond reseated herself, and watched him\r\nas he opened the letter. She had expected him to be surprised.\r\n\r\nWhile Lydgate’s eyes glanced rapidly over the brief letter, she saw his\r\nface, usually of a pale brown, taking on a dry whiteness; with nostrils\r\nand lips quivering he tossed down the letter before her, and said\r\nviolently—\r\n\r\n“It will be impossible to endure life with you, if you will always be\r\nacting secretly—acting in opposition to me and hiding your actions.”\r\n\r\nHe checked his speech and turned his back on her—then wheeled round and\r\nwalked about, sat down, and got up again restlessly, grasping hard the\r\nobjects deep down in his pockets. He was afraid of saying something\r\nirremediably cruel.\r\n\r\nRosamond too had changed color as she read. The letter ran in this\r\nway:—\r\n\r\n“DEAR TERTIUS,—Don’t set your wife to write to me when you have\r\nanything to ask. It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I\r\nshould not have credited you with. I never choose to write to a woman\r\non matters of business. As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds,\r\nor only half that sum, I can do nothing of the sort. My own family\r\ndrains me to the last penny. With two younger sons and three daughters,\r\nI am not likely to have cash to spare. You seem to have got through\r\nyour own money pretty quickly, and to have made a mess where you are;\r\nthe sooner you go somewhere else the better. But I have nothing to do\r\nwith men of your profession, and can’t help you there. I did the best I\r\ncould for you as guardian, and let you have your own way in taking to\r\nmedicine. You might have gone into the army or the Church. Your money\r\nwould have held out for that, and there would have been a surer ladder\r\nbefore you. Your uncle Charles has had a grudge against you for not\r\ngoing into his profession, but not I. I have always wished you well,\r\nbut you must consider yourself on your own legs entirely now.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour affectionate uncle,\r\nGODWIN LYDGATE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Rosamond had finished reading the letter she sat quite still, with\r\nher hands folded before her, restraining any show of her keen\r\ndisappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her\r\nhusband’s wrath. Lydgate paused in his movements, looked at her again,\r\nand said, with biting severity—\r\n\r\n“Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret\r\nmeddling? Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to\r\njudge and act for me—to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which\r\nit belongs to me to decide on?”\r\n\r\nThe words were hard; but this was not the first time that Lydgate had\r\nbeen frustrated by her. She did not look at him, and made no reply.\r\n\r\n“I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have cost me\r\npain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use. But it has\r\nbeen of no use for me to think of anything. You have always been\r\ncounteracting me secretly. You delude me with a false assent, and then\r\nI am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to resist every wish I\r\nexpress, say so and defy me. I shall at least know what I am doing\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love’s\r\nbond has turned to this power of galling. In spite of Rosamond’s\r\nself-control a tear fell silently and rolled over her lips. She still\r\nsaid nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an intense effect: she\r\nwas in such entire disgust with her husband that she wished she had\r\nnever seen him. Sir Godwin’s rudeness towards her and utter want of\r\nfeeling ranged him with Dover and all other creditors—disagreeable\r\npeople who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying\r\nthey were to her. Even her father was unkind, and might have done more\r\nfor them. In fact there was but one person in Rosamond’s world whom she\r\ndid not regard as blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature with\r\nblond plaits and with little hands crossed before her, who had never\r\nexpressed herself unbecomingly, and had always acted for the best—the\r\nbest naturally being what she best liked.\r\n\r\nLydgate pausing and looking at her began to feel that half-maddening\r\nsense of helplessness which comes over passionate people when their\r\npassion is met by an innocent-looking silence whose meek victimized air\r\nseems to put them in the wrong, and at last infects even the justest\r\nindignation with a doubt of its justice. He needed to recover the full\r\nsense that he was in the right by moderating his words.\r\n\r\n“Can you not see, Rosamond,” he began again, trying to be simply grave\r\nand not bitter, “that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and\r\nconfidence between us? It has happened again and again that I have\r\nexpressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to assent, yet after that\r\nyou have secretly disobeyed my wish. In that way I can never know what\r\nI have to trust to. There would be some hope for us if you would admit\r\nthis. Am I such an unreasonable, furious brute? Why should you not be\r\nopen with me?” Still silence.\r\n\r\n“Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend\r\non your not acting secretly in future?” said Lydgate, urgently, but\r\nwith something of request in his tone which Rosamond was quick to\r\nperceive. She spoke with coolness.\r\n\r\n“I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words\r\nas you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to language of\r\nthat kind. You have spoken of my ‘secret meddling,’ and my ‘interfering\r\nignorance,’ and my ‘false assent.’ I have never expressed myself in\r\nthat way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize. You spoke of\r\nits being impossible to live with me. Certainly you have not made my\r\nlife pleasant to me of late. I think it was to be expected that I\r\nshould try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has\r\nbrought on me.” Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she\r\npressed it away as quietly as the first.\r\n\r\nLydgate flung himself into a chair, feeling checkmated. What place was\r\nthere in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in? He laid down his hat,\r\nflung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked down for some\r\nmoments without speaking. Rosamond had the double purchase over him of\r\ninsensibility to the point of justice in his reproach, and of\r\nsensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her married\r\nlife. Although her duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded\r\nwhat he knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it,\r\nshe had no consciousness that her action could rightly be called false.\r\nWe are not obliged to identify our own acts according to a strict\r\nclassification, any more than the materials of our grocery and clothes.\r\nRosamond felt that she was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate\r\nhad to recognize.\r\n\r\nAs for him, the need of accommodating himself to her nature, which was\r\ninflexible in proportion to its negations, held him as with pincers. He\r\nhad begun to have an alarmed foresight of her irrevocable loss of love\r\nfor him, and the consequent dreariness of their life. The ready fulness\r\nof his emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the first\r\nviolent movements of his anger. It would assuredly have been a vain\r\nboast in him to say that he was her master.\r\n\r\n“You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—“the hardships which\r\nour marriage has brought on me”—these words were stinging his\r\nimagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If he were not only\r\nto sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous\r\nfettering of domestic hate?\r\n\r\n“Rosamond,” he said, turning his eyes on her with a melancholy look,\r\n“you should allow for a man’s words when he is disappointed and\r\nprovoked. You and I cannot have opposite interests. I cannot part my\r\nhappiness from yours. If I am angry with you, it is that you seem not\r\nto see how any concealment divides us. How could I wish to make\r\nanything hard to you either by my words or conduct? When I hurt you, I\r\nhurt part of my own life. I should never be angry with you if you would\r\nbe quite open with me.”\r\n\r\n“I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into wretchedness\r\nwithout any necessity,” said Rosamond, the tears coming again from a\r\nsoftened feeling now that her husband had softened. “It is so very hard\r\nto be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in such\r\na miserable way. I wish I had died with the baby.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and\r\ntears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man. Lydgate drew his chair near\r\nto hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his\r\npowerful tender hand. He only caressed her; he did not say anything;\r\nfor what was there to say? He could not promise to shield her from the\r\ndreaded wretchedness, for he could see no sure means of doing so. When\r\nhe left her to go out again, he told himself that it was ten times\r\nharder for her than for him: he had a life away from home, and constant\r\nappeals to his activity on behalf of others. He wished to excuse\r\neverything in her if he could—but it was inevitable that in that\r\nexcusing mood he should think of her as if she were an animal of\r\nanother and feebler species. Nevertheless she had mastered him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\n’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\r\nAnother thing to fall.\r\n—_Measure for Measure_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his\r\npractice did him in counteracting his personal cares. He had no longer\r\nfree energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking,\r\nbut by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls on his\r\njudgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw him\r\nout of himself. It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine\r\nwhich enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live\r\ncalmly—it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of\r\nthought, and on the consideration of another’s need and trial. Many of\r\nus looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have\r\never known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine\r\ntact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in our\r\nneed with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some\r\nof that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the\r\nHospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet\r\nand sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental degeneracy.\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother’s suspicion as to the opiate was true, however. Under\r\nthe first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first\r\nperception that his marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness,\r\nmust be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about\r\nbeing loved, he had once or twice tried a dose of opium. But he had no\r\nhereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the\r\nhauntings of misery. He was strong, could drink a great deal of wine,\r\nbut did not care about it; and when the men round him were drinking\r\nspirits, he took sugar and water, having a contemptuous pity even for\r\nthe earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with\r\ngambling. He had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris,\r\nwatching it as if it had been a disease. He was no more tempted by such\r\nwinning than he was by drink. He had said to himself that the only\r\nwinning he cared for must be attained by a conscious process of high,\r\ndifficult combination tending towards a beneficent result. The power he\r\nlonged for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a\r\nheap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic triumph in the\r\neyes of a man who sweeps within his arms the ventures of twenty\r\nchapfallen companions.\r\n\r\nBut just as he had tried opium, so his thought now began to turn upon\r\ngambling—not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort of\r\nwistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied\r\nno asking and brought no responsibility. If he had been in London or\r\nParis at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by\r\nopportunity, would have taken him into a gambling-house, no longer to\r\nwatch the gamblers, but to watch with them in kindred eagerness.\r\nRepugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if\r\nchance would be kind enough to let him. An incident which happened not\r\nvery long after that airy notion of getting aid from his uncle had been\r\nexcluded, was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any\r\nextant opportunity of gambling.\r\n\r\nThe billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a\r\ncertain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were\r\nregarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made\r\npart of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been\r\nobliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in\r\nMiddlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and\r\nthe consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation\r\nnaturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there.\r\nProbably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry,\r\nwished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to\r\nthemselves concerning it; but they were not a closed community, and\r\nmany decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the\r\nbilliard-room to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular\r\naptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in\r\nthe early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the\r\ncue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game,\r\nand no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he\r\nhad occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had\r\nengaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for which\r\nLydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this\r\nreduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared now for\r\nevery small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his\r\ntradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing, would\r\nsave time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bambridge was not yet come, but would be sure to arrive by-and-by,\r\nsaid his friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the\r\nsake of passing the time. That evening he had the peculiar light in the\r\neyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr.\r\nFarebrother. The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in\r\nthe room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and\r\nseveral lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with\r\nanimation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were\r\ndropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable\r\ngain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began\r\nto bet on his own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come\r\nin, but Lydgate did not notice him. He was not only excited with his\r\nplay, but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to\r\nBrassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and\r\nwhere, by one powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it\r\noff without the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings.\r\n\r\nHe was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them was a\r\nyoung Hawley, just come from his law studies in town, and the other was\r\nFred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of\r\nhis. Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool\r\nfresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and\r\nastonished to see him betting with an excited air, stood aside, and\r\nkept out of the circle round the table.\r\n\r\nFred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. He had\r\nbeen working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under\r\nMr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the\r\ndefects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the\r\nless severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s\r\nunder the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at\r\nLowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s\r\nresidence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial\r\nplans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned\r\ninto the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the\r\nold flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,\r\nconsidered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He\r\nhad not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own\r\nto ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his\r\ngig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a\r\nlittle too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the\r\ntraces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. “I will tell\r\nyou what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to learn\r\nsurveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,”\r\nhe had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her\r\nsake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They\r\nhad sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.” And now,\r\nMary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other\r\nstrong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his\r\nchain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.\r\nThere could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he\r\nwas determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his mind\r\nthe heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr.\r\nGarth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving\r\nup all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of\r\nclothes, and no expense in his board. In that way he could, in one\r\nyear, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had\r\ndeprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more\r\nthan she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this\r\nevening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room,\r\nFred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he\r\nmeant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having before\r\nhim the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely\r\nto be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund\r\nfrom which he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good\r\nbet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he\r\ncatch a few? He would never go far along that road again; but a man\r\nlikes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could\r\ndo in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from\r\nmaking himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost\r\nlooseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is\r\nnot because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,\r\nwhich are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling\r\nreturns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was\r\nlurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to\r\nplay he should also begin to bet—that he should enjoy some\r\npunch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling “rather\r\nseedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action\r\noften begins.\r\n\r\nBut the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was that\r\nhe should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never quite\r\ndropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious\r\nof his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself\r\nmight have done. Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account\r\nfor by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his\r\nfather had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into\r\nthe play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes:\r\nFred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to\r\ngive attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement,\r\nlooking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight\r\nof something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of\r\nself-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to\r\nlie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking\r\nwith that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal\r\nwith fierce eyes and retractile claws.\r\n\r\nLydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but\r\nyoung Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made\r\nfirst-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes,\r\nthe strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in\r\nhis own movements to defying another person’s doubt in them. The\r\ndefiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.\r\nHe continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail. Still he\r\nwent on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous\r\ncrevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred\r\nobserved that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new\r\nsituation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which,\r\nwithout being offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and\r\nperhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room. He saw that\r\nothers were observing Lydgate’s strange unlikeness to himself, and it\r\noccurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a\r\nmoment might rouse him from his absorption. He could think of nothing\r\ncleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see\r\nRosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was\r\ngoing desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up\r\nto him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and\r\nbegged to speak with him.\r\n\r\nFred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he\r\nwould be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate,\r\nsaid, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him aside.\r\n\r\n“Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he wants to speak\r\nto me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if\r\nyou had anything to say to him.”\r\n\r\nFred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could\r\nnot say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare\r\nat you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have\r\nserved him better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present,\r\nand his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had\r\nthe effect of a sharp concussion.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to him.\r\nBut—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see Bambridge.”\r\n\r\n“Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think he’s\r\nready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect he is\r\ngoing to blow me up, and you will shield me,” said Fred, with some\r\nadroitness.\r\n\r\nLydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it, by\r\nrefusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down. They merely shook\r\nhands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned\r\ninto the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to\r\nLydgate. His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and\r\nhe said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some\r\npressing business with you. Walk with me to St. Botolph’s, will you?”\r\n\r\nIt was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother\r\nproposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the\r\nLondon road. The next thing he said was—\r\n\r\n“I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”\r\n\r\n“So did I,” said Fred. “But he said that he went to see Bambridge.”\r\n\r\n“He was not playing, then?”\r\n\r\nFred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, “Yes,\r\nhe was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen him\r\nthere before.”\r\n\r\n“You have been going often yourself, then, lately?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, about five or six times.”\r\n\r\n“I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be catechised in\r\nthis way. “I made a clean breast to you.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It is\r\nunderstood between us, is it not?—that we are on a footing of open\r\nfriendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen\r\nto me. I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?”\r\n\r\n“I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred,\r\nin a state of uncomfortable surmise.\r\n\r\n“I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.\r\nBut I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to\r\nreverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody\r\nsaid to me, ‘Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every\r\nnight again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I was tempted to do the\r\nopposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue and wait while you went\r\ndown the ladder again, betting first and then—”\r\n\r\n“I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.\r\n\r\n“Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you\r\ntake the wrong turning, wear out Garth’s patience, and lose the best\r\nopportunity of your life—the opportunity which you made some rather\r\ndifficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that\r\ntemptation in me—I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that the\r\nsatisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of\r\nthe fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice\r\ngave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred’s alarm.\r\n\r\n“I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a moment’s\r\nhesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.\r\n\r\n“Clearly not, when her affection met yours. But relations of this sort,\r\neven when they are of long standing, are always liable to change. I can\r\neasily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels\r\ntowards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound\r\nto you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that\r\nhe has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place\r\nin her love as well as respect which you had let slip. I can easily\r\nconceive such a result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. “There\r\nis a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage\r\neven over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.\r\nFarebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable\r\ntongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He had a\r\nhorrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was\r\na knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.\r\n\r\n“Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said, in a\r\ntroubled voice. “If she is beginning to compare—” He broke off, not\r\nliking to betray all he felt, and then said, by the help of a little\r\nbitterness, “But I thought you were friendly to me.”\r\n\r\n“So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition\r\nto be otherwise. I have said to myself, ‘If there is a likelihood of\r\nthat youngster doing himself harm, why should you interfere? Aren’t you\r\nworth as much as he is, and don’t your sixteen years over and above\r\nhis, in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to\r\nsatisfaction than he has? If there’s a chance of his going to the dogs,\r\nlet him—perhaps you could nohow hinder it—and do you take the\r\nbenefit.’”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable\r\nchill. What was coming next? He dreaded to hear that something had been\r\nsaid to Mary—he felt as if he were listening to a threat rather than a\r\nwarning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like\r\nthe encouraging transition to a major key.\r\n\r\n“But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old\r\nintention. I thought that I could hardly _secure myself_ in it better,\r\nFred, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you\r\nunderstand me? I want you to make the happiness of her life and your\r\nown, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn\r\naside any risk to the contrary—well, I have uttered it.”\r\n\r\nThere was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last words. He\r\npaused—they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged\r\ntowards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if to imply that the\r\nconversation was closed. Fred was moved quite newly. Some one highly\r\nsusceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that it\r\nproduces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes\r\none feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was\r\njust then present in Fred Vincy.\r\n\r\n“I will try to be worthy,” he said, breaking off before he could say\r\n“of you as well as of her.” And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered\r\nthe impulse to say something more.\r\n\r\n“You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any decline in\r\nher preference of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep\r\nright, other things will keep right.”\r\n\r\n“I shall never forget what you have done,” Fred answered. “I can’t say\r\nanything that seems worth saying—only I will try that your goodness\r\nshall not be thrown away.”\r\n\r\n“That’s enough. Good-by, and God bless you.”\r\n\r\nIn that way they parted. But both of them walked about a long while\r\nbefore they went out of the starlight. Much of Fred’s rumination might\r\nbe summed up in the words, “It certainly would have been a fine thing\r\nfor her to marry Farebrother—but if she loves me best and I am a good\r\nhusband?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Farebrother’s might be concentrated into a single shrug and\r\none little speech. “To think of the part one little woman can play in\r\nthe life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a very good imitation\r\nof heroism, and to win her may be a discipline!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nNow is there civil war within the soul:\r\nResolve is thrust from off the sacred throne\r\nBy clamorous Needs, and Pride the grand-vizier\r\nMakes humble compact, plays the supple part\r\nOf envoy and deft-tongued apologist\r\nFor hungry rebels.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappily Lydgate had ended by losing in the billiard-room, and brought\r\naway no encouragement to make a raid on luck. On the contrary, he felt\r\nunmixed disgust with himself the next day when he had to pay four or\r\nfive pounds over and above his gains, and he carried about with him a\r\nmost unpleasant vision of the figure he had made, not only rubbing\r\nelbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did.\r\nA philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a\r\nPhilistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be\r\nfound in his subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very\r\ndisagreeable cud in that way. His reason told him how the affair might\r\nhave been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery—if it had\r\nbeen a gambling-house that he had turned into, where chance could be\r\nclutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and\r\nfore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to\r\ngamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to\r\nthe needful amount, he would have liked to gamble, rather than take the\r\nalternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.\r\n\r\nThat alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode. Lydgate had so many\r\ntimes boasted both to himself and others that he was totally\r\nindependent of Bulstrode, to whose plans he had lent himself solely\r\nbecause they enabled him to carry out his own ideas of professional\r\nwork and public benefit—he had so constantly in their personal\r\nintercourse had his pride sustained by the sense that he was making a\r\ngood social use of this predominating banker, whose opinions he thought\r\ncontemptible and whose motives often seemed to him an absurd mixture of\r\ncontradictory impressions—that he had been creating for himself strong\r\nideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to him on\r\nhis own account.\r\n\r\nStill, early in March his affairs were at that pass in which men begin\r\nto say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance, and to perceive\r\nthat the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming\r\nmanifestly possible. With Dover’s ugly security soon to be put in\r\nforce, with the proceeds of his practice immediately absorbed in paying\r\nback debts, and with the chance, if the worst were known, of daily\r\nsupplies being refused on credit, above all with the vision of\r\nRosamond’s hopeless discontent continually haunting him, Lydgate had\r\nbegun to see that he should inevitably bend himself to ask help from\r\nsomebody or other. At first he had considered whether he should write\r\nto Mr. Vincy; but on questioning Rosamond he found that, as he had\r\nsuspected, she had already applied twice to her father, the last time\r\nbeing since the disappointment from Sir Godwin; and papa had said that\r\nLydgate must look out for himself. “Papa said he had come, with one bad\r\nyear after another, to trade more and more on borrowed capital, and had\r\nhad to give up many indulgences; he could not spare a single hundred\r\nfrom the charges of his family. He said, let Lydgate ask Bulstrode:\r\nthey have always been hand and glove.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he must end\r\nby asking for a free loan, his relations with Bulstrode, more at least\r\nthan with any other man, might take the shape of a claim which was not\r\npurely personal. Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure\r\nof his practice, and had also been highly gratified by getting a\r\nmedical partner in his plans:—but who among us ever reduced himself to\r\nthe sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood, without trying to\r\nbelieve that he had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking?\r\nIt was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of\r\ninterest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his health had got worse,\r\nand showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection. In other respects\r\nhe did not appear to be changed: he had always been highly polite, but\r\nLydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his\r\nmarriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he had\r\nhitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them. He\r\ndeferred the intention from day to day, his habit of acting on his\r\nconclusions being made infirm by his repugnance to every possible\r\nconclusion and its consequent act. He saw Mr. Bulstrode often, but he\r\ndid not try to use any occasion for his private purpose. At one moment\r\nhe thought, “I will write a letter: I prefer that to any circuitous\r\ntalk;” at another he thought, “No; if I were talking to him, I could\r\nmake a retreat before any signs of disinclination.”\r\n\r\nStill the days passed and no letter was written, no special interview\r\nsought. In his shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude\r\ntowards Bulstrode, he began to familiarize his imagination with another\r\nstep even more unlike his remembered self. He began spontaneously to\r\nconsider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion\r\nof Rosamond’s which had often made him angry, namely, that they should\r\nquit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface. The\r\nquestion came—“Would any man buy the practice of me even now, for as\r\nlittle as it is worth? Then the sale might happen as a necessary\r\npreparation for going away.”\r\n\r\nBut against his taking this step, which he still felt to be a\r\ncontemptible relinquishment of present work, a guilty turning aside\r\nfrom what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy\r\nactivity, to start again without any justified destination, there was\r\nthis obstacle, that the purchaser, if procurable at all, might not be\r\nquickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond in a poor lodging, though\r\nin the largest city or most distant town, would not find the life that\r\ncould save her from gloom, and save him from the reproach of having\r\nplunged her into it. For when a man is at the foot of the hill in his\r\nfortunes, he may stay a long while there in spite of professional\r\naccomplishment. In the British climate there is no incompatibility\r\nbetween scientific insight and furnished lodgings: the incompatibility\r\nis chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who objects to that\r\nkind of residence.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of his hesitation, opportunity came to decide him. A\r\nnote from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him at the Bank. A\r\nhypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker’s constitution\r\nof late; and a lack of sleep, which was really only a slight\r\nexaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom, had been dwelt on by him\r\nas a sign of threatening insanity. He wanted to consult Lydgate without\r\ndelay on that particular morning, although he had nothing to tell\r\nbeyond what he had told before. He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had\r\nto say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only\r\nrepetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical\r\nopinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a\r\npersonal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation\r\nbeforehand. He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr.\r\nBulstrode to relax his attention to business.\r\n\r\n“One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate\r\nframe,” said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks\r\ntend to pass from the personal to the general, “by the deep stamp which\r\nanxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous. I am\r\nnaturally very strong; yet I have been thoroughly shaken lately by an\r\naccumulation of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“I presume that a constitution in the susceptible state in which mine\r\nat present is, would be especially liable to fall a victim to cholera,\r\nif it visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we\r\nmay well besiege the Mercy-seat for our protection,” said Mr.\r\nBulstrode, not intending to evade Lydgate’s allusion, but really\r\npreoccupied with alarms about himself.\r\n\r\n“You have at all events taken your share in using good practical\r\nprecautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for\r\nprotection,” said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken\r\nmetaphor and bad logic of the banker’s religion, somewhat increased by\r\nthe apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its\r\nlong-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested.\r\nHe added, “The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding\r\nappliances; and I think that if the cholera should come, even our\r\nenemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“Truly,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with some coldness. “With regard to what\r\nyou say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have\r\nfor some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a\r\nvery decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal\r\nfrom the management of much business, whether benevolent or commercial.\r\nAlso I think of changing my residence for a time: probably I shall\r\nclose or let ‘The Shrubs,’ and take some place near the coast—under\r\nadvice of course as to salubrity. That would be a measure which you\r\nwould recommend?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Lydgate, falling backward in his chair, with\r\nill-repressed impatience under the banker’s pale earnest eyes and\r\nintense preoccupation with himself.\r\n\r\n“I have for some time felt that I should open this subject with you in\r\nrelation to our Hospital,” continued Bulstrode. “Under the\r\ncircumstances I have indicated, of course I must cease to have any\r\npersonal share in the management, and it is contrary to my views of\r\nresponsibility to continue a large application of means to an\r\ninstitution which I cannot watch over and to some extent regulate. I\r\nshall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch,\r\nconsider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that\r\nwhich will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of\r\nbuilding it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful\r\nworking.”\r\n\r\nLydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was,\r\n“He has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most\r\nplausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling\r\nchange in his expectations. He said in reply—\r\n\r\n“The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone;\r\n“except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly\r\ncounted on as willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon. I\r\nhave had an interview with her on the subject, and I have pointed out\r\nto her, as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a\r\nmore general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.”\r\nAnother pause, but Lydgate did not speak.\r\n\r\n“The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the\r\nNew Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder\r\ninstitution, having the same directing board. It will be necessary,\r\nalso, that the medical management of the two shall be combined. In this\r\nway any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new\r\nestablishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town\r\nwill cease to be divided.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate’s face to the buttons\r\nof his coat as he again paused.\r\n\r\n“No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,” said Lydgate,\r\nwith an edge of irony in his tone. “But I can’t be expected to rejoice\r\nin it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other\r\nmedical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because\r\nthey are mine.”\r\n\r\n“I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of\r\nnew and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the\r\noriginal plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under\r\nsubmission to the Divine Will. But since providential indications\r\ndemand a renunciation from me, I renounce.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.\r\nThe broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his\r\nhearer’s contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the\r\nfacts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation\r\nand disappointment. After some rapid reflection, he only asked—\r\n\r\n“What did Mrs. Casaubon say?”\r\n\r\n“That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,” said\r\nBulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation.\r\n“She is, you are aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and\r\nhappily in possession—not I presume of great wealth, but of funds which\r\nshe can well spare. She has informed me that though she has destined\r\nthe chief part of those funds to another purpose, she is willing to\r\nconsider whether she cannot fully take my place in relation to the\r\nHospital. But she wishes for ample time to mature her thoughts on the\r\nsubject, and I have told her that there is no need for haste—that, in\r\nfact, my own plans are not yet absolute.”\r\n\r\nLydgate was ready to say, “If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place,\r\nthere would be gain, instead of loss.” But there was still a weight on\r\nhis mind which arrested this cheerful candor. He replied, “I suppose,\r\nthen, that I may enter into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; that is what she expressly desires. Her decision, she says,\r\nwill much depend on what you can tell her. But not at present: she is,\r\nI believe, just setting out on a journey. I have her letter here,” said\r\nMr. Bulstrode, drawing it out, and reading from it. “‘I am immediately\r\notherwise engaged,’ she says. ‘I am going into Yorkshire with Sir James\r\nand Lady Chettam; and the conclusions I come to about some land which I\r\nam to see there may affect my power of contributing to the Hospital.’\r\nThus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste necessary in this matter; but I\r\nwished to apprise you beforehand of what may possibly occur.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side-pocket, and changed his\r\nattitude as if his business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope\r\nabout the Hospital only made him more conscious of the facts which\r\npoisoned his hope, felt that his effort after help, if made at all,\r\nmust be made now and vigorously.\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,” he said, with a\r\nfirm intention in his tone, yet with an interruptedness in his delivery\r\nwhich showed that he spoke unwillingly. “The highest object to me is my\r\nprofession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I can\r\nat present make of my profession. But the best use is not always the\r\nsame with monetary success. Everything which has made the Hospital\r\nunpopular has helped with other causes—I think they are all connected\r\nwith my professional zeal—to make me unpopular as a practitioner. I get\r\nchiefly patients who can’t pay me. I should like them best, if I had\r\nnobody to pay on my own side.” Lydgate waited a little, but Bulstrode\r\nonly bowed, looking at him fixedly, and he went on with the same\r\ninterrupted enunciation—as if he were biting an objectional leek.\r\n\r\n“I have slipped into money difficulties which I can see no way out of,\r\nunless some one who trusts me and my future will advance me a sum\r\nwithout other security. I had very little fortune left when I came\r\nhere. I have no prospects of money from my own family. My expenses, in\r\nconsequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had\r\nexpected. The result at this moment is that it would take a thousand\r\npounds to clear me. I mean, to free me from the risk of having all my\r\ngoods sold in security of my largest debt—as well as to pay my other\r\ndebts—and leave anything to keep us a little beforehand with our small\r\nincome. I find that it is out of the question that my wife’s father\r\nshould make such an advance. That is why I mention my position to—to\r\nthe only other man who may be held to have some personal connection\r\nwith my prosperity or ruin.”\r\n\r\nLydgate hated to hear himself. But he had spoken now, and had spoken\r\nwith unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but\r\nalso without hesitation.\r\n\r\n“I am grieved, though, I confess, not surprised by this information,\r\nMr. Lydgate. For my own part, I regretted your alliance with my\r\nbrother-in-law’s family, which has always been of prodigal habits, and\r\nwhich has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its\r\npresent position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that instead\r\nof involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a doubtful\r\nstruggle, you should simply become a bankrupt.”\r\n\r\n“That would not improve my prospect,” said Lydgate, rising and speaking\r\nbitterly, “even if it were a more agreeable thing in itself.”\r\n\r\n“It is always a trial,” said Mr. Bulstrode; “but trial, my dear sir, is\r\nour portion here, and is a needed corrective. I recommend you to weigh\r\nthe advice I have given.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Lydgate, not quite knowing what he said. “I have\r\noccupied you too long. Good-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nWhat suit of grace hath Virtue to put on\r\nIf Vice shall wear as good, and do as well?\r\nIf Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion\r\nAct as fair parts with ends as laudable?\r\nWhich all this mighty volume of events\r\nThe world, the universal map of deeds,\r\nStrongly controls, and proves from all descents,\r\nThat the directest course still best succeeds.\r\nFor should not grave and learn’d Experience\r\nThat looks with the eyes of all the world beside,\r\nAnd with all ages holds intelligence,\r\nGo safer than Deceit without a guide!\r\n—DANIEL: _Musophilus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or\r\nbetrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him\r\nby some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of\r\nMr. Larcher’s sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when\r\nthe banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move\r\nDivine Providence to arrest painful consequences.\r\n\r\nHis certainty that Raffles, unless he were dead, would return to\r\nMiddlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve he had\r\nreappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive him, and\r\nhinder his communication with the rest of the family, but he could not\r\naltogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising\r\nhimself and alarming his wife. Raffles proved more unmanageable than he\r\nhad shown himself to be in his former appearances, his chronic state of\r\nmental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance,\r\nquickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him. He\r\ninsisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of\r\nevils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his\r\ngoing into the town. He kept him in his own room for the evening and\r\nsaw him to bed, Raffles all the while amusing himself with the\r\nannoyance he was causing this decent and highly prosperous\r\nfellow-sinner, an amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy\r\nwith his friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been\r\nserviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a\r\ncunning calculation under this noisy joking—a cool resolve to extract\r\nsomething the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this\r\nnew application of torture. But his cunning had a little overcast its\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nBulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles\r\ncould enable him to imagine. He had told his wife that he was simply\r\ntaking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might\r\notherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of\r\nfalsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him to this care,\r\nand that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged\r\ncaution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next\r\nmorning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode\r\nwith precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and\r\naccounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even\r\nwith food and drink. But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should\r\nbe overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts—lest Mrs.\r\nBulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could he\r\nhinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?\r\nShe was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so\r\nlow a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was\r\nstronger than the calculation of probabilities.\r\n\r\nIn this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an\r\neffect which had not been in his plan. By showing himself hopelessly\r\nunmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the\r\nonly resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker\r\nordered his closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next\r\nmorning. At six o’clock he had already been long dressed, and had spent\r\nsome of his wretchedness in prayer, pleading his motives for averting\r\nthe worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was\r\nnot true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an\r\nintensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds.\r\nBut many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements\r\nwhich are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring\r\nabout the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is only what\r\nwe are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by\r\nOmniscience.\r\n\r\nBulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was\r\napparently in a painful dream. He stood silent, hoping that the\r\npresence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and\r\ngently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden\r\nawakening. He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the\r\nshudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when\r\nRaffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him\r\nin terror, trembling and gasping. But he made no further noise, and\r\nBulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his recovery.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold\r\nperemptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I came\r\nto call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the\r\ncarriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct\r\nyou as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a\r\ncoach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him\r\nimperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to\r\nsay. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a\r\nreasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter;\r\nbut if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to\r\nMiddlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you\r\nwill have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without\r\nhelp from me. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know the\r\nworst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust\r\nyourself upon me again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without\r\nnoise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and\r\nyou may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you\r\nshall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses there.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy: he\r\nhad been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a\r\nlarge part of the night; and though he did not trust to its ultimately\r\nsaving him from any return of Raffles, he had concluded that it was the\r\nbest throw he could make. It succeeded in enforcing submission from the\r\njaded man this morning: his empoisoned system at this moment quailed\r\nbefore Bulstrode’s cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly\r\nin the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined\r\nhim to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man\r\nlike their master, who held his head high in the world, should be\r\nashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The banker’s drive\r\nof ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the\r\nChristmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his\r\nspirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good\r\nreason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds. Various motives\r\nurged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire\r\nclosely into all of them. As he had stood watching Raffles in his\r\nuneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been\r\nmuch shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nHe had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not\r\nto be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the\r\nfact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to\r\nthe risks of defying him. But when, freed from his repulsive presence,\r\nBulstrode returned to his quiet home, he brought with him no confidence\r\nthat he had secured more than a respite. It was as if he had had a\r\nloathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful\r\nkindred of sensations—as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his\r\nlife a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.\r\n\r\nWho can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the\r\nthoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of\r\nopinion is threatened with ruin?\r\n\r\nBulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of\r\nuneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided\r\nany allusion to it. He had been used every day to taste the flavor of\r\nsupremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that\r\nhe was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some\r\ndiscreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to\r\nedification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious temperament, is\r\noften worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the\r\nanguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of\r\nRaffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result\r\nhe hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to\r\nhimself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a\r\nchastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and\r\nhe judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should\r\nescape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations\r\nfor quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported of him, he\r\nwould then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old\r\nneighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered\r\nthe same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be\r\nless formidable. To leave the place finally would, he knew, be\r\nextremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have\r\npreferred to stay where he had struck root. Hence he made his\r\npreparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all\r\nsides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable\r\nintervention of Providence should dissipate his fears. He was preparing\r\nto transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active\r\ncontrol of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground\r\nof his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of\r\nsuch work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some\r\ndiminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the\r\ngeneral depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a\r\nprincipal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.\r\n\r\nThis was the experience which had determined his conversation with\r\nLydgate. But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no\r\nfarther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be\r\nunnecessary. He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of\r\nhis fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being\r\ndashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging\r\nimpression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to\r\nspoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially\r\nsince it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the\r\nproject of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would\r\nlike to live.\r\n\r\nAmong the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the\r\nfarm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on\r\nall other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or\r\nabout Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else\r\nwho had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more\r\nanxious for his employer’s interests than his own. With regard to Stone\r\nCourt, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to\r\nhave an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his\r\nfavorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to\r\ntrust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements\r\nyearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.\r\n\r\n“May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?”\r\nsaid Bulstrode. “And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would\r\nrepay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll think about it,” said Caleb, in his blunt way. “I’ll see how I\r\ncan make it out.”\r\n\r\nIf it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future, Mr.\r\nGarth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of\r\nwhich his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.\r\nBut on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea\r\noccurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court. What if\r\nBulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the\r\nunderstanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the\r\nmanagement? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make\r\na modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by\r\nhelping in other business. He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with\r\nsuch evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by\r\nexpressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.\r\n\r\n“The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself back in\r\nhis chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was all\r\nsettled. Think; Susan! His mind had been running on that place for\r\nyears before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn of\r\nthings as could be that he should hold the place in a good industrious\r\nway after all—by his taking to business. For it’s likely enough\r\nBulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the stock. He hasn’t\r\nmade up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall settle somewhere\r\nelse as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a notion in my\r\nlife. And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure\r\nthat Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of\r\ngentle caution. “And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help\r\nto hasten it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside. “Marriage is a\r\ntaming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I\r\nshall say nothing till I know the ground I’m treading on. I shall speak\r\nto Bulstrode again.”\r\n\r\nHe took his earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything\r\nbut a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a strong wish\r\nto secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points of business at\r\nwhich he was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less\r\nconscientious management. On that ground he made no objection to Mr.\r\nGarth’s proposal; and there was also another reason why he was not\r\nsorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.\r\nIt was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been\r\nanxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor\r\nRosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that\r\nLydgate’s affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan\r\nwas to let them “take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for\r\nthe first time, “I think you are always a little hard towards my\r\nfamily, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my\r\nrelatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that\r\nthey were not respectable.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s eyes,\r\nwhich were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother with a\r\ngreat deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of his married\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into\r\npity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always\r\nforeseen the fruits of.\r\n\r\nBut remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to\r\ntalk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he\r\nshould be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might\r\nbe for the good of her nephew Fred. At present he had merely mentioned\r\nto her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and\r\ntaking a house on the Southern Coast.\r\n\r\nHence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of\r\nBulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred\r\nVincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nCaleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to\r\nthings, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little\r\naffectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to\r\nMary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained\r\nhimself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he\r\nwas making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the\r\nstate of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. He was\r\ncertainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events\r\nrequired him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in\r\noccupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in\r\nstore like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.\r\n\r\n“But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the\r\nair?” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” replied Caleb; “the castle will tumble about nobody’s\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\n“If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee.”\r\n—_Ecclesiasticus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager’s room at the Bank, about\r\nthree o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there,\r\nwhen the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting, and also that\r\nMr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him.\r\n\r\n“By all means,” said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. “Pray sit down, Mr.\r\nGarth,” continued the banker, in his suavest tone.\r\n\r\n“I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you\r\ncount your minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as\r\nhe seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers\r\ndroop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it\r\nwere sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his\r\nslowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be\r\nimportant, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying\r\nof some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down,\r\nas a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of\r\nair and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that\r\nCaleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually\r\nfound Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they\r\nhad got on well together. When he spoke again, however, it was to say,\r\nin rather a subdued voice—\r\n\r\n“I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”\r\n\r\n“You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there\r\nmyself yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a\r\nstranger, who is very ill, I think. He wants a doctor, and I came to\r\ntell you of that. His name is Raffles.”\r\n\r\nHe saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. On\r\nthis subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly\r\non the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips\r\ntrembled a little. “Do you know how he came there?”\r\n\r\n“I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. He had\r\ngot down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning\r\nfrom the toll-house, and I overtook him. He remembered seeing me with\r\nyou once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. I saw\r\nhe was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under\r\nshelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for\r\nhim.” Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended, and rose slowly\r\nfrom his seat.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.\r\n“Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr.\r\nLydgate’s as you pass—or stay! he may at this hour probably be at the\r\nHospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this\r\ninstant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the\r\ncommission to his man. When he returned, Caleb was standing as before\r\nwith one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other.\r\nIn Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only\r\nspoke to Garth of his illness. Garth may wonder, as he must have done\r\nbefore, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he\r\nwill know nothing. And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”\r\n\r\nHe longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have\r\nasked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been\r\nto betray fear.\r\n\r\n“I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual\r\ntone of politeness. “My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I\r\nshall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.\r\nPerhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to\r\nwaive the invitation. “I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must\r\nrequest you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am\r\nobliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me—about the letting of\r\nStone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up.” A sharp\r\ncertainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode’s soul.\r\n\r\n“This is sudden, Mr. Garth,” was all he could say at first.\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see\r\nthat Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking\r\ndried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him.\r\nCaleb felt a deep pity for him, but he could have used no pretexts to\r\naccount for his resolve, even if they would have been of any use.\r\n\r\n“You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me\r\nuttered by that unhappy creature,” said Bulstrode, anxious now to know\r\nthe utmost.\r\n\r\n“That is true. I can’t deny that I act upon what I heard from him.”\r\n\r\n“You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth—a man, I trust, who feels\r\nhimself accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being\r\ntoo ready to believe a slander,” said Bulstrode, casting about for\r\npleas that might be adapted to his hearer’s mind. “That is a poor\r\nreason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be\r\nmutually beneficial.”\r\n\r\n“I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I\r\nthought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my\r\nfellow-creature. But, sir—I am obliged to believe that this Raffles has\r\ntold me the truth. And I can’t be happy in working with you, or\r\nprofiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another\r\nagent.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that\r\nhe has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable\r\nto be the victim of,” said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger\r\nbeginning to mingle with his humiliation before this quiet man who\r\nrenounced his benefits.\r\n\r\n“That’s needless,” said Caleb, waving his hand, bowing his head\r\nslightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful\r\nintention to spare this pitiable man. “What he has said to me will\r\nnever pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from\r\nme. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of their\r\nrights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you\r\nrepent—you would like to go back, and can’t: that must be a bitter\r\nthing”—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—“it is not for me to\r\nmake your life harder to you.”\r\n\r\n“But you do—you do make it harder to me,” said Bulstrode constrained\r\ninto a genuine, pleading cry. “You make it harder to me by turning your\r\nback on me.”\r\n\r\n“That I’m forced to do,” said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his\r\nhand. “I am sorry. I don’t judge you and say, he is wicked, and I am\r\nrighteous. God forbid. I don’t know everything. A man may do wrong, and\r\nhis will may rise clear out of it, though he can’t get his life clear.\r\nThat’s a bad punishment. If it is so with you,—well, I’m very sorry for\r\nyou. But I have that feeling inside me, that I can’t go on working with\r\nyou. That’s all, Mr. Bulstrode. Everything else is buried, so far as my\r\nwill goes. And I wish you good-day.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, Mr. Garth!” said Bulstrode, hurriedly. “I may trust then\r\nto your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or\r\nwoman what—even if it have any degree of truth in it—is yet a malicious\r\nrepresentation?” Caleb’s wrath was stirred, and he said, indignantly—\r\n\r\n“Why should I have said it if I didn’t mean it? I am in no fear of you.\r\nSuch tales as that will never tempt my tongue.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me—I am agitated—I am the victim of this abandoned man.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn’t help to make\r\nhim worse, when you profited by his vices.”\r\n\r\n“You are wronging me by too readily believing him,” said Bulstrode,\r\noppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what\r\nRaffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had\r\nnot so stated it to him as to ask for that flat denial.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Caleb, lifting his hand deprecatingly; “I am ready to\r\nbelieve better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As\r\nto speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man’s sin unless I’m clear\r\nit must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr.\r\nBulstrode, and what I say, I’ve no need to swear. I wish you good-day.”\r\n\r\nSome hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife,\r\nincidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode,\r\nand that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone\r\nCourt, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him.\r\n\r\n“He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth,\r\nimagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and\r\nnot been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Mrs.\r\nGarth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nAs for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set\r\noff for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.\r\n\r\nHis mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language\r\nto his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which\r\nshake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced\r\nunder Caleb Garth’s knowledge of his past and rejection of his\r\npatronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety\r\nin the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles\r\nhad spoken. It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended\r\nhis rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for\r\nthe hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with illness,\r\nthat he should have been led to Stone Court rather than\r\nelsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities\r\nwhich these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed\r\nfrom all danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his\r\nlife should be more consecrated than it had ever been before. He\r\nmentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed\r\nfor—he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution—its\r\npotency to determine death. He knew that he ought to say, “Thy will be\r\ndone;” and he said it often. But the intense desire remained that the\r\nwill of God might be the death of that hated man.\r\n\r\nYet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in\r\nRaffles without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode\r\nwould have called the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his\r\nloud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to\r\ndeprecate Bulstrode’s anger, because the money was all gone—he had been\r\nrobbed—it had half of it been taken from him. He had only come here\r\nbecause he was ill and somebody was hunting him—somebody was after him,\r\nhe had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut. Bulstrode, not\r\nknowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new\r\nnervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true\r\nconfessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not\r\ntold anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his\r\ngig and brought him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn\r\nadjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were\r\ninterrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to\r\nCaleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which\r\nhad dropped back into darkness.\r\n\r\nBulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp\r\nover the wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be\r\ntrusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or\r\nnot he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except\r\nCaleb Garth. The housekeeper had told him without the least constraint\r\nof manner that since Mr. Garth left, Raffles had asked her for beer,\r\nand after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side it might\r\nbe concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs. Abel thought, like\r\nthe servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the\r\nunpleasant “kin” who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at\r\nfirst referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property\r\nleft, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural\r\nenough. How he could be “kin” to Bulstrode as well was not so clear,\r\nbut Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was “no knowing,” a\r\nproposition which had a great deal of mental food for her, so that she\r\nshook her head over it without further speculation.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met him outside the\r\nwainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said—\r\n\r\n“I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once\r\nin my employment, many years ago. Afterwards he went to America, and\r\nreturned I fear to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, he has a\r\nclaim on me. He was slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of\r\nthis place, and in consequence found his way here. I believe he is\r\nseriously ill: apparently his mind is affected. I feel bound to do the\r\nutmost for him.”\r\n\r\nLydgate, who had the remembrance of his last conversation with\r\nBulstrode strongly upon him, was not disposed to say an unnecessary\r\nword to him, and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just\r\nbefore entering the room he turned automatically and said, “What is his\r\nname?”—to know names being as much a part of the medical man’s\r\naccomplishment as of the practical politician’s.\r\n\r\n“Raffles, John Raffles,” said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became\r\nof Raffles, Lydgate would never know any more of him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate\r\nordered that he should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete\r\nquiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room.\r\n\r\n“It is a serious case, I apprehend,” said the banker, before Lydgate\r\nbegan to speak.\r\n\r\n“No—and yes,” said Lydgate, half dubiously. “It is difficult to decide\r\nas to the possible effect of long-standing complications; but the man\r\nhad a robust constitution to begin with. I should not expect this\r\nattack to be fatal, though of course the system is in a ticklish state.\r\nHe should be well watched and attended to.”\r\n\r\n“I will remain here myself,” said Bulstrode. “Mrs. Abel and her husband\r\nare inexperienced. I can easily remain here for the night, if you will\r\noblige me by taking a note for Mrs. Bulstrode.”\r\n\r\n“I should think that is hardly necessary,” said Lydgate. “He seems tame\r\nand terrified enough. He might become more unmanageable. But there is a\r\nman here—is there not?”\r\n\r\n“I have more than once stayed here a few nights for the sake of\r\nseclusion,” said Bulstrode, indifferently; “I am quite disposed to do\r\nso now. Mrs. Abel and her husband can relieve or aid me, if necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Then I need give my directions only to you,” said Lydgate,\r\nnot feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n“You think, then, that the case is hopeful?” said Bulstrode, when\r\nLydgate had ended giving his orders.\r\n\r\n“Unless there turn out to be further complications, such as I have not\r\nat present detected—yes,” said Lydgate. “He may pass on to a worse\r\nstage; but I should not wonder if he got better in a few days, by\r\nadhering to the treatment I have prescribed. There must be firmness.\r\nRemember, if he calls for liquors of any sort, not to give them to him.\r\nIn my opinion, men in his condition are oftener killed by treatment\r\nthan by the disease. Still, new symptoms may arise. I shall come again\r\nto-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode, Lydgate\r\nrode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the\r\nhistory of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately\r\nbeen much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware’s abundant experience\r\nin America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic\r\npoisoning such as this. Lydgate, when abroad, had already been\r\ninterested in this question: he was strongly convinced against the\r\nprevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering\r\nlarge doses of opium; and he had repeatedly acted on this conviction\r\nwith a favorable result.\r\n\r\n“The man is in a diseased state,” he thought, “but there’s a good deal\r\nof wear in him still. I suppose he is an object of charity to\r\nBulstrode. It is curious what patches of hardness and tenderness lie\r\nside by side in men’s dispositions. Bulstrode seems the most\r\nunsympathetic fellow I ever saw about some people, and yet he has taken\r\nno end of trouble, and spent a great deal of money, on benevolent\r\nobjects. I suppose he has some test by which he finds out whom Heaven\r\ncares for—he has made up his mind that it doesn’t care for me.”\r\n\r\nThis streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept\r\nwidening in the current of his thought as he neared Lowick Gate. He had\r\nnot been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning,\r\nhaving been found at the Hospital by the banker’s messenger; and for\r\nthe first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any\r\nexpedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money\r\nenough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which\r\nmade his married life tolerable—everything which saved him and Rosamond\r\nfrom that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how\r\nlittle of a comfort they could be to each other. It was more bearable\r\nto do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own\r\ntenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her.\r\nThe sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were\r\nkeen enough, yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself from that\r\nmore acute pain which dominated them—the pain of foreseeing that\r\nRosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of\r\ndisappointment and unhappiness to her. He had never liked the\r\nmakeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his\r\nprospects for himself; but he was beginning now to imagine how two\r\ncreatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common,\r\nmight laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far\r\nthey could afford butter and eggs. But the glimpse of that poetry\r\nseemed as far off from him as the carelessness of the golden age; in\r\npoor Rosamond’s mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look\r\nsmall in. He got down from his horse in a very sad mood, and went into\r\nthe house, not expecting to be cheered except by his dinner, and\r\nreflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell\r\nRosamond of his application to Bulstrode and its failure. It would be\r\nwell not to lose time in preparing her for the worst.\r\n\r\nBut his dinner waited long for him before he was able to eat it. For on\r\nentering he found that Dover’s agent had already put a man in the\r\nhouse, and when he asked where Mrs. Lydgate was, he was told that she\r\nwas in her bedroom. He went up and found her stretched on the bed pale\r\nand silent, without an answer even in her face to any word or look of\r\nhis. He sat down by the bed and leaning over her said with almost a cry\r\nof prayer—\r\n\r\n“Forgive me for this misery, my poor Rosamond! Let us only love one\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him silently, still with the blank despair on her face;\r\nbut then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled.\r\nThe strong man had had too much to bear that day. He let his head fall\r\nbeside hers and sobbed.\r\n\r\nHe did not hinder her from going to her father early in the morning—it\r\nseemed now that he ought not to hinder her from doing as she pleased.\r\nIn half an hour she came back, and said that papa and mamma wished her\r\nto go and stay with them while things were in this miserable state.\r\nPapa said he could do nothing about the debt—if he paid this, there\r\nwould be half-a-dozen more. She had better come back home again till\r\nLydgate had got a comfortable home for her. “Do you object, Tertius?”\r\n\r\n“Do as you like,” said Lydgate. “But things are not coming to a crisis\r\nimmediately. There is no hurry.”\r\n\r\n“I should not go till to-morrow,” said Rosamond; “I shall want to pack\r\nmy clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I would wait a little longer than to-morrow—there is no knowing\r\nwhat may happen,” said Lydgate, with bitter irony. “I may get my neck\r\nbroken, and that may make things easier to you.”\r\n\r\nIt was Lydgate’s misfortune and Rosamond’s too, that his tenderness\r\ntowards her, which was both an emotional prompting and a\r\nwell-considered resolve, was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts\r\nof indignation either ironical or remonstrant. She thought them totally\r\nunwarranted, and the repulsion which this exceptional severity excited\r\nin her was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\n“I see you do not wish me to go,” she said, with chill mildness; “why\r\ncan you not say so, without that kind of violence? I shall stay until\r\nyou request me to do otherwise.”\r\n\r\nLydgate said no more, but went out on his rounds. He felt bruised and\r\nshattered, and there was a dark line under his eyes which Rosamond had\r\nnot seen before. She could not bear to look at him. Tertius had a way\r\nof taking things which made them a great deal worse for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\n“Our deeds still travel with us from afar,\r\nAnd what we have been makes us what we are.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBulstrode’s first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to\r\nexamine Raffles’s pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry signs\r\nin the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in, if he had\r\nnot told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool\r\nbecause he was ill and had no money. There were various bills crammed\r\ninto his pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any\r\nother place, except one, which bore date that morning. This was\r\ncrumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his\r\ntail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days’ stay at an inn at\r\nBilkley, where the fair was held—a town at least forty miles from\r\nMiddlemarch. The bill was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with\r\nhim, it seemed probable that he had left his portmanteau behind in\r\npayment, in order to save money for his travelling fare; for his purse\r\nwas empty, and he had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence\r\nin his pockets.\r\n\r\nBulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that\r\nRaffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his\r\nmemorable visit at Christmas. At a distance and among people who were\r\nstrangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to Raffles’s\r\ntormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories\r\nabout a Middlemarch banker? And what harm if he did talk? The chief\r\npoint now was to keep watch over him as long as there was any danger of\r\nthat intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which\r\nseemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much\r\nanxiety lest some such impulse should come over him at the sight of\r\nLydgate. He sat up alone with him through the night, only ordering the\r\nhousekeeper to lie down in her clothes, so as to be ready when he\r\ncalled her, alleging his own indisposition to sleep, and his anxiety to\r\ncarry out the doctor’s orders. He did carry them out faithfully,\r\nalthough Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that\r\nhe was sinking away—that the earth was sinking away from under him. He\r\nwas restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable. On the\r\noffer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he refused, and the denial\r\nof other things which he demanded, he seemed to concentrate all his\r\nterror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his anger, his revenge on\r\nhim by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that he had never\r\ntold any mortal a word against him. Even this Bulstrode felt that he\r\nwould not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of\r\nfitful alternation in his delirium was, that in-the morning twilight\r\nRaffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him and\r\ndeclaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge\r\nfor telling, when he never had told.\r\n\r\nBulstrode’s native imperiousness and strength of determination served\r\nhim well. This delicate-looking man, himself nervously perturbed, found\r\nthe needed stimulus in his strenuous circumstances, and through that\r\ndifficult night and morning, while he had the air of an animated corpse\r\nreturned to movement without warmth, holding the mastery by its chill\r\nimpassibility, his mind was intensely at work thinking of what he had\r\nto guard against and what would win him security. Whatever prayers he\r\nmight lift up, whatever statements he might inwardly make of this man’s\r\nwretched spiritual condition, and the duty he himself was under to\r\nsubmit to the punishment divinely appointed for him rather than to wish\r\nfor evil to another—through all this effort to condense words into a\r\nsolid mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible\r\nvividness the images of the events he desired. And in the train of\r\nthose images came their apology. He could not but see the death of\r\nRaffles, and see in it his own deliverance. What was the removal of\r\nthis wretched creature? He was impenitent—but were not public criminals\r\nimpenitent?—yet the law decided on their fate. Should Providence in\r\nthis case award death, there was no sin in contemplating death as the\r\ndesirable issue—if he kept his hands from hastening it—if he\r\nscrupulously did what was prescribed. Even here there might be a\r\nmistake: human prescriptions were fallible things: Lydgate had said\r\nthat treatment had hastened death,—why not his own method of treatment?\r\nBut of course intention was everything in the question of right and\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAnd Bulstrode set himself to keep his intention separate from his\r\ndesire. He inwardly declared that he intended to obey orders. Why\r\nshould he have got into any argument about the validity of these\r\norders? It was only the common trick of desire—which avails itself of\r\nany irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for itself in all\r\nuncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks like the\r\nabsence of law. Still, he did obey the orders.\r\n\r\nHis anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and his remembrance\r\nof what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied\r\nwith sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual\r\nscene. He had then cared but little about Lydgate’s painful impressions\r\nwith regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or about the\r\ndisposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable\r\nrefusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth. He recurred to\r\nthe scene now with a perception that he had probably made Lydgate his\r\nenemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate him, or rather to\r\ncreate in him a strong sense of personal obligation. He regretted that\r\nhe had not at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice. For in\r\ncase of unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the\r\nraving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in\r\nLydgate’s mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on him. But the\r\nregret had perhaps come too late.\r\n\r\nStrange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who had\r\nlonged for years to be better than he was—who had taken his selfish\r\npassions into discipline and clad them in severe robes, so that he had\r\nwalked with them as a devout choir, till now that a terror had risen\r\namong them, and they could chant no longer, but threw out their common\r\ncries for safety.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: he had\r\nmeant to come earlier, but had been detained, he said; and his\r\nshattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he immediately threw\r\nhimself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly\r\ninto all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take hardly any\r\nfood, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not\r\nviolent. Contrary to Bulstrode’s alarmed expectation, he took little\r\nnotice of Lydgate’s presence, and continued to talk or murmur\r\nincoherently.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of him?” said Bulstrode, in private.\r\n\r\n“The symptoms are worse.”\r\n\r\n“You are less hopeful?”\r\n\r\n“No; I still think he may come round. Are you going to stay here\r\nyourself?” said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question,\r\nwhich made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any\r\nsuspicious conjecture.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so,” said Bulstrode, governing himself and speaking with\r\ndeliberation. “Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain\r\nme. Mrs. Abel and her husband are not experienced enough to be left\r\nquite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in\r\ntheir service of me. You have some fresh instructions, I presume.”\r\n\r\nThe chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the\r\nadministration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the\r\nsleeplessness continuing after several hours. He had taken the\r\nprecaution of bringing opium in his pocket, and he gave minute\r\ndirections to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they\r\nshould cease. He insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated his\r\norder that no alcohol should be given.\r\n\r\n“From what I see of the case,” he ended, “narcotism is the only thing I\r\nshould be much afraid of. He may wear through even without much food.\r\nThere’s a good deal of strength in him.”\r\n\r\n“You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate—a most unusual, I may say\r\nunprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,” said Bulstrode, showing a\r\nsolicitude as unlike his indifference the day before, as his present\r\nrecklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his habitual\r\nself-cherishing anxiety. “I fear you are harassed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am,” said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his hat, and ready to go.\r\n\r\n“Something new, I fear,” said Bulstrode, inquiringly. “Pray be seated.”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you,” said Lydgate, with some hauteur. “I mentioned to you\r\nyesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing to add,\r\nexcept that the execution has since then been actually put into my\r\nhouse. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence. I will\r\nsay good morning.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,” said Bulstrode; “I have been reconsidering\r\nthis subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it\r\nsuperficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her niece, and I myself\r\nshould grieve at a calamitous change in your position. Claims on me are\r\nnumerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it right that I should incur\r\na small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided. You said, I think,\r\nthat a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your\r\nburthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every\r\nother feeling; “that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on\r\nhand. I could set about economizing in our way of living. And by-and-by\r\nmy practice might look up.”\r\n\r\n“If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a check to that\r\namount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should be\r\nthorough.”\r\n\r\nWhile Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his\r\nhome—thinking of his life with its good start saved from frustration,\r\nits good purposes still unbroken.\r\n\r\n“You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,” said the\r\nbanker, advancing towards him with the check. “And by-and-by, I hope,\r\nyou may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile, I have\r\npleasure in thinking that you will be released from further\r\ndifficulty.”\r\n\r\n“I am deeply obliged to you,” said Lydgate. “You have restored to me\r\nthe prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should\r\nhave reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent\r\nside of his character. But as he put his hack into a canter, that he\r\nmight get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get\r\ncash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent, there crossed his mind,\r\nwith an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil\r\naugury across his vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which\r\na few months had brought—that he should be overjoyed at being under a\r\nstrong personal obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money\r\nfor himself from Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nThe banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of\r\nuneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier. He did not measure the\r\nquantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate’s\r\ngood-will, but the quantity was none the less actively there, like an\r\nirritating agent in his blood. A man vows, and yet will not cast away\r\nthe means of breaking his vow. Is it that he distinctly means to break\r\nit? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in\r\nhim dimly, and make their way into his imagination, and relax his\r\nmuscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the\r\nreasons for his vow. Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the free\r\nuse of his odious powers—how could Bulstrode wish for that? Raffles\r\ndead was the image that brought release, and indirectly he prayed for\r\nthat way of release, beseeching that, if it were possible, the rest of\r\nhis days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which\r\nwould break him utterly as an instrument of God’s service. Lydgate’s\r\nopinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be\r\nfulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself getting\r\nirritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would fain have\r\nseen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred\r\nmurderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself,\r\nhad no power. He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn; he\r\nwould not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave him to Mrs. Abel,\r\nwho, if necessary, could call her husband.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of\r\nsleep, from which he waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries\r\nthat he was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium\r\naccording to Lydgate’s directions. At the end of half an hour or more\r\nhe called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for\r\nfurther watching. He must now consign the patient to her care; and he\r\nproceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s directions as to the quantity of\r\neach dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate’s\r\nprescriptions; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode\r\nordered, and had done what he pointed out to her. She began now to ask\r\nwhat else she should do besides administering the opium.\r\n\r\n“Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water:\r\nyou can come to me for further directions. Unless there is any\r\nimportant change, I shall not come into the room again to-night. You\r\nwill ask your husband for help if necessary. I must go to bed early.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take\r\nsomething more strengthening than what you’ve done.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in\r\nhis raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to\r\ncreate any dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk this. He went\r\ndown into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he\r\nwould not have his horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give\r\nup caring for earthly consequences. Then, he wished that he had begged\r\nLydgate to come again that evening. Perhaps he might deliver a\r\ndifferent opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less\r\nhopeful state. Should he send for Lydgate? If Raffles were really\r\ngetting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed\r\nand sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might\r\ncome and simply say that he was going on as he expected, and predict\r\nthat he would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was\r\nthe use of sending for him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas\r\nor opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be,\r\nthat Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with his\r\nstrength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his wife to\r\nspend her years apart from her friends and native place, carrying an\r\nalienating suspicion against him in her heart.\r\n\r\nHe had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only,\r\nwhen a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle, which he\r\nhad brought down with him. The thought was, that he had not told Mrs.\r\nAbel when the doses of opium must cease.\r\n\r\nHe took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.\r\nShe might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed. But\r\nit was excusable in him, that he should forget part of an order, in his\r\npresent wearied condition. He walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not\r\nknowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed,\r\nor turn to the patient’s room and rectify his omission. He paused in\r\nthe passage, with his face turned towards Raffles’s room, and he could\r\nhear him moaning and murmuring. He was not asleep, then. Who could know\r\nthat Lydgate’s prescription would not be better disobeyed than\r\nfollowed, since there was still no sleep?\r\n\r\nHe turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel\r\nrapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that he could hear her\r\nspeak low.\r\n\r\n“If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the\r\npoor creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he\r\nswaller—and but little strength in it, if he did—only the opium. And he\r\nsays more and more he’s sinking down through the earth.”\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n“I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that way.\r\nWhen I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him port-wine\r\nand brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,” added Mrs. Abel, with\r\na touch of remonstrance in her tone.\r\n\r\nBut again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she continued,\r\n“It’s not a time to spare when people are at death’s door, nor would\r\nyou wish it, sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him our own bottle o’\r\nrum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as you’ve been, and doing\r\neverything as laid in your power—”\r\n\r\nHere a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode\r\nsaid huskily, “That is the key of the wine-cooler. You will find plenty\r\nof brandy there.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time\r\nin prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily\r\ncandid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is\r\ninaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent\r\nhimself just as he is, even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not\r\nyet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last\r\nfour-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\nHe listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.\r\nThen he walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the\r\ngrass and fresh spring leaves. When he re-entered the house, he felt\r\nstartled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.\r\n\r\n“How is your patient—asleep, I think?” he said, with an attempt at\r\ncheerfulness in his tone.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual\r\nbetween three and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at him?\r\nI thought it no harm to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and the little\r\ngirl’s seeing to the kettles.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the\r\nsleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and\r\ndeeper into the gulf of death.\r\n\r\nHe looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and\r\nthe almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of sight, and\r\ncarried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking it again in the\r\nwine-cooler.\r\n\r\nWhile breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch\r\nat once, or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to wait, and told\r\nMrs. Abel that she might go about her work—he could watch in the\r\nbed-chamber.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably\r\ninto silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for many months.\r\nHis conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which\r\nseemed just then like an angel sent down for his relief. He drew out\r\nhis pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the\r\narrangements he had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of\r\nquitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he would let them stand or\r\nrecall them, now that his absence would be brief. Some economies which\r\nhe felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary\r\nwithdrawal from management, and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would\r\ntake a large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the\r\nmoments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked\r\nenough to draw his attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think\r\nof the departing life, which had once been subservient to his own—which\r\nhe had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he\r\nwould. It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad that\r\nthe life was at an end.\r\n\r\nAnd who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who knew\r\nwhat would have saved him?\r\n\r\nLydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of\r\nthe breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden\r\nexpression in his face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition\r\nthat he had not judged correctly. He stood by the bed in silence for\r\nsome time, with his eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued\r\nactivity of expression which showed that he was carrying on an inward\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n“When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n“I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was over-worn,\r\nand left him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he sank into sleep\r\nbetween three and four o’clock. When I came in before eight he was\r\nnearly in this condition.”\r\n\r\nLydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he\r\nsaid, “It’s all over.”\r\n\r\nThis morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He\r\nhad set out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself\r\nstrong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life. And he\r\nwas conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him. But he was\r\nuneasy about this case. He had not expected it to terminate as it had\r\ndone. Yet he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to\r\nBulstrode without appearing to insult him; and if he examined the\r\nhousekeeper—why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in\r\nimplying that somebody’s ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And\r\nafter all, he himself might be wrong.\r\n\r\nHe and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many\r\nthings—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House\r\nof Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was\r\nsaid about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of\r\nhaving a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far\r\nas he knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had\r\nstated to be unfriendly towards him.\r\n\r\nOn returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar\r\nhad not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an\r\nexecution in Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the evening, having\r\nbeen carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from\r\nhis brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that\r\nevening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred\r\nVincy, Mr. Farebrother’s thoughts about him had been rather gloomy.\r\nPlaying at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in\r\nanother man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was\r\ngetting unlike his former self. He was beginning to do things for which\r\nhe had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain\r\ndissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had\r\ngiven him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother\r\nfelt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being\r\nmore and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion\r\nof Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be\r\nquite illusory. The rebuff he had met with in his first attempt to win\r\nLydgate’s confidence, disinclined him to a second; but this news of the\r\nexecution being actually in the house, determined the Vicar to overcome\r\nhis reluctance.\r\n\r\nLydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much\r\ninterested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open\r\ncheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a proud\r\nrejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and help\r\nshould be offered.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something\r\nwhich made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the tone of a good\r\nbrother, only that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated\r\nby this time, and Lydgate answered immediately—\r\n\r\n“I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an\r\nexecution in the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; is it true?”\r\n\r\n“It was true,” said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he did not\r\nmind talking about the affair now. “But the danger is over; the debt is\r\npaid. I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and\r\nable, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan.”\r\n\r\n“I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in his\r\nchair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows\r\nthe removal of a load. “I like that better than all the news in the\r\n‘Times.’ I confess I came to you with a heavy heart.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy the\r\nkindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a\r\ngood deal crushed. I’m afraid I shall find the bruises still painful\r\nby-and by,” he added, smiling rather sadly; “but just now I can only\r\nfeel that the torture-screw is off.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “My\r\ndear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a\r\nliberty.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.”\r\n\r\n“Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have not—have\r\nyou?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass\r\nyou worse hereafter?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly. “There is no reason why I should\r\nnot tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I am indebted\r\nis Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a thousand\r\npounds—and he can afford to wait for repayment.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to\r\napprove of the man whom he disliked. His delicate feeling shrank from\r\ndwelling even in his thought on the fact that he had always urged\r\nLydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode. He added\r\nimmediately, “And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your\r\nwelfare, after you have worked with him in a way which has probably\r\nreduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad to think that he\r\nhas acted accordingly.”\r\n\r\nLydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions. They made\r\nmore distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had shown its\r\nfirst dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode’s motives\r\nfor his sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest\r\nindifference might be merely selfish. He let the kindly suppositions\r\npass. He could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more\r\nvividly present with him than ever, as well as the fact which the Vicar\r\ndelicately ignored—that this relation of personal indebtedness to\r\nBulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid.\r\n\r\nHe began, instead of answering, to speak of his projected economies,\r\nand of his having come to look at his life from a different point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n“I shall set up a surgery,” he said. “I really think I made a mistaken\r\neffort in that respect. And if Rosamond will not mind, I shall take an\r\napprentice. I don’t like these things, but if one carries them out\r\nfaithfully they are not really lowering. I have had a severe galling to\r\nbegin with: that will make the small rubs seem easy.”\r\n\r\nPoor Lydgate! the “if Rosamond will not mind,” which had fallen from\r\nhim involuntarily as part of his thought, was a significant mark of the\r\nyoke he bore. But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into\r\nthe same current with Lydgate’s, and who knew nothing about him that\r\ncould now raise a melancholy presentiment, left him with affectionate\r\ncongratulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\n_Clown_. . . . ’Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed,\r\nyou have a delight to sit, have you not?\r\n_Froth_. I have so: because it is an open room, and good for winter.\r\n_Clo_. Why, very well then: I hope here be truths.\r\n—_Measure for Measure_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing at his\r\nleisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green\r\nDragon. He was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he had only just\r\ncome out of the house, and any human figure standing at ease under the\r\narchway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship\r\nas a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at. In this case\r\nthere was no material object to feed upon, but the eye of reason saw a\r\nprobability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip. Mr. Hopkins,\r\nthe meek-mannered draper opposite, was the first to act on this inward\r\nvision, being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk because his\r\ncustomers were chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the\r\ndraper, feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to _him_, but\r\nthat he was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins. Soon,\r\nhowever, there was a small cluster of more important listeners, who\r\nwere either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the spot\r\nexpressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green Dragon;\r\nand Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his while to say many impressive\r\nthings about the fine studs he had been seeing and the purchases he had\r\nmade on a journey in the north from which he had just returned.\r\nGentlemen present were assured that when they could show him anything\r\nto cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising four, which was to be seen at\r\nDoncaster if they chose to go and look at it, Mr. Bambridge would\r\ngratify them by being shot “from here to Hereford.” Also, a pair of\r\nblacks which he was going to put into the break recalled vividly to his\r\nmind a pair which he had sold to Faulkner in ’19, for a hundred\r\nguineas, and which Faulkner had sold for a hundred and sixty two months\r\nlater—any gent who could disprove this statement being offered the\r\nprivilege of calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the\r\nexercise made his throat dry.\r\n\r\nWhen the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr. Frank\r\nHawley. He was not a man to compromise his dignity by lounging at the\r\nGreen Dragon, but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing\r\nBambridge on the other side, he took some of his long strides across to\r\nask the horsedealer whether he had found the first-rate gig-horse which\r\nhe had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he\r\nhad seen a gray selected at Bilkley: if that did not meet his wishes to\r\na hair, Bambridge did not know a horse when he saw it, which seemed to\r\nbe the highest conceivable unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his\r\nback to the street, was fixing a time for looking at the gray and\r\nseeing it tried, when a horseman passed slowly by.\r\n\r\n“Bulstrode!” said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one of\r\nthem, which was the draper’s, respectfully prefixing the “Mr.;” but\r\nnobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they\r\nhad said “the Riverston coach” when that vehicle appeared in the\r\ndistance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode’s back,\r\nbut as Bambridge’s eyes followed it he made a sarcastic grimace.\r\n\r\n“By jingo! that reminds me,” he began, lowering his voice a little, “I\r\npicked up something else at Bilkley besides your gig-horse, Mr. Hawley.\r\nI picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do you know how he came by\r\nhis fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can\r\ngive it him free of expense. If everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode\r\nmight have had to say his prayers at Botany Bay.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his hands into his\r\npockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If Bulstrode\r\nshould turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul.\r\n\r\n“I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode’s. I’ll tell\r\nyou where I first picked him up,” said Bambridge, with a sudden gesture\r\nof his fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I knew nothing of\r\nhim then—he slipped through my fingers—was after Bulstrode, no doubt.\r\nHe tells me he can tap Bulstrode to any amount, knows all his secrets.\r\nHowever, he blabbed to me at Bilkley: he takes a stiff glass. Damme if\r\nI think he meant to turn king’s evidence; but he’s that sort of\r\nbragging fellow, the bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him, till\r\nhe’d brag of a spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man should know when\r\nto pull up.” Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust,\r\nsatisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the marketable.\r\n\r\n“What’s the man’s name? Where can he be found?” said Mr. Hawley.\r\n\r\n“As to where he is to be found, I left him to it at the Saracen’s Head;\r\nbut his name is Raffles.”\r\n\r\n“Raffles!” exclaimed Mr. Hopkins. “I furnished his funeral yesterday.\r\nHe was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A very decent\r\nfuneral.” There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr.\r\nBambridge gave an ejaculation in which “brimstone” was the mildest\r\nword, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and bending his head forward,\r\nexclaimed, “What?—where did the man die?”\r\n\r\n“At Stone Court,” said the draper. “The housekeeper said he was a\r\nrelation of the master’s. He came there ill on Friday.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it was on Wednesday I took a glass with him,” interposed\r\nBambridge.\r\n\r\n“Did any doctor attend him?” said Mr. Hawley\r\n\r\n“Yes. Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Bulstrode sat up with him one night. He died the\r\nthird morning.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, Bambridge,” said Mr. Hawley, insistently. “What did this fellow\r\nsay about Bulstrode?”\r\n\r\nThe group had already become larger, the town-clerk’s presence being a\r\nguarantee that something worth listening to was going on there; and Mr.\r\nBambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of seven. It was\r\nmainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some\r\nlocal color and circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded\r\nthe betrayal of—and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of\r\nRaffles—it was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode\r\npast the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence\r\nhad delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not confessed to\r\nhimself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to this\r\nend; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was\r\nimpossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the\r\ndeparture of that man’s soul.\r\n\r\nBut this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the\r\nsmell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending\r\na clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring\r\nabout hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles\r\nand his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge\r\nthat Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr.\r\nHawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at\r\nhis office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it\r\nwere required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb\r\nwas betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which\r\nhe was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the\r\nlast week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that\r\nRaffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up\r\nBulstrode’s affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr.\r\nToller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp\r\nof an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from\r\nGarth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to\r\nbe the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the\r\nlaw either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances\r\nof his death. He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might\r\nlook at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr.\r\nFarebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly\r\nsecret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he had always\r\nhad justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into\r\nconclusions. But while they were talking another combination was\r\nsilently going forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed\r\nwhat was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary\r\n“putting of two and two together.” With the reasons which kept\r\nBulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread\r\nmight have something to do with his munificence towards his medical\r\nman; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously\r\naccepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this\r\ncomplication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s\r\nreputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the\r\nsudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from\r\nall approaches towards the subject.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable\r\ndiscussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally\r\nproven, “it is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer\r\ngenealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made\r\na likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have\r\nsuspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing\r\nwhat a mixture will turn out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to\r\nclarify.”\r\n\r\n“It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley, mounting his\r\nhorse. “Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy.”\r\n\r\n“I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a\r\ndisinterested, unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had been in\r\nthe habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned\r\npleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on\r\nRaffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of\r\nBulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not\r\nonly to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts\r\nin Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and\r\ncomments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears\r\nof other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a\r\nsignificant relation between this sudden command of money and\r\nBulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money\r\ncame from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there\r\nhad been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into\r\nthe gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor\r\nhis own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was\r\nfurnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs.\r\nBulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who\r\nmentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who\r\nmentioned it generally. The business was felt to be so public and\r\nimportant that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations\r\nwere just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal\r\nconcerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took\r\ntheir work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public\r\nconviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which\r\ncould not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out\r\nthe Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nFor hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at\r\nthe bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in\r\nthe first instance, invited a select party, including the two\r\nphysicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close\r\ndiscussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s illness, reciting to\r\nthem all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in\r\nconnection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due to\r\ndelirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood\r\nundisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared\r\nthat they could see nothing in these particulars which could be\r\ntransformed into a positive ground of suspicion. But the moral grounds\r\nof suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for\r\nwishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment\r\nhe had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known\r\nthe need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode\r\nwould be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe\r\nthat Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when\r\nthey have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had been\r\ngiven merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of\r\nBulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate,\r\nwho had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the\r\nbanker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and\r\ndiscrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in spite of\r\nthe negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at\r\nStone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with the sense that the\r\naffair had “an ugly look.”\r\n\r\nBut this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to\r\nkeep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial\r\nprofessional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power\r\nof mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the\r\nthing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more\r\nconfident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the\r\nincompatible. Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode’s\r\nearlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as\r\nso much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such\r\nfantastic shapes as heaven pleased.\r\n\r\nThis was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the\r\nspirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to\r\nresist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their\r\nreports from the outer world were of equal force with what had “come\r\nup” in her mind. How it had been brought to her she didn’t know, but it\r\nwas there before her as if it had been “scored with the chalk on the\r\nchimney-board—” as Bulstrode should say, “his inside was _that black_\r\nas if the hairs of his head knowed the thoughts of his heart, he’d tear\r\n’em up by the roots.”\r\n\r\n“That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and\r\na piping voice. “Why, I read in the ‘Trumpet’ that was what the Duke of\r\nWellington said when he turned his coat and went over to the Romans.”\r\n\r\n“Very like,” said Mrs. Dollop. “If one raskill said it, it’s more\r\nreason why another should. But hypo_crite_ as he’s been, and holding\r\nthings with that high hand, as there was no parson i’ the country good\r\nenough for him, he was forced to take Old Harry into his counsel, and\r\nOld Harry’s been too many for him.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, he’s a ’complice you can’t send out o’ the country,” said Mr.\r\nCrabbe, the glazier, who gathered much news and groped among it dimly.\r\n“But by what I can make out, there’s them says Bulstrode was for\r\nrunning away, for fear o’ being found out, before now.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll be drove away, whether or no,” said Mr. Dill, the barber, who\r\nhad just dropped in. “I shaved Fletcher, Hawley’s clerk, this\r\nmorning—he’s got a bad finger—and he says they’re all of one mind to\r\nget rid of Bulstrode. Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him\r\nout o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town says they’d as\r\nsoon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ‘And a deal sooner I would,’\r\nsays Fletcher; ‘for what’s more against one’s stomach than a man coming\r\nand making himself bad company with his religion, and giving out as the\r\nTen Commandments are not enough for him, and all the while he’s worse\r\nthan half the men at the tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money goes\r\nout of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a firm-voiced\r\ndyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“But he won’t keep his money, by what I can make out,” said the\r\nglazier. “Don’t they say as there’s somebody can strip it off him? By\r\nwhat I can understan’, they could take every penny off him, if they\r\nwent to lawing.”\r\n\r\n“No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little above his\r\ncompany at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse. “Fletcher says it’s\r\nno such thing. He says they might prove over and over again whose child\r\nthis young Ladislaw was, and they’d do no more than if they proved I\r\ncame out of the Fens—he couldn’t touch a penny.”\r\n\r\n“Look you there now!” said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. “I thank the Lord\r\nhe took my children to Himself, if that’s all the law can do for the\r\nmotherless. Then by that, it’s o’ no use who your father and mother is.\r\nBut as to listening to what one lawyer says without asking another—I\r\nwonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It’s well known there’s\r\nalways two sides, if no more; else who’d go to law, I should like to\r\nknow? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if\r\nit’s no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he\r\nlikes, but I say, don’t Fletcher _me_!”\r\n\r\nMr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop, as a\r\nwoman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being disposed to\r\nsubmit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“If they come to lawing, and it’s all true as folks say, there’s more\r\nto be looked to nor money,” said the glazier. “There’s this poor\r\ncreetur as is dead and gone; by what I can make out, he’d seen the day\r\nwhen he was a deal finer gentleman nor Bulstrode.”\r\n\r\n“Finer gentleman! I’ll warrant him,” said Mrs. Dollop; “and a far\r\npersonabler man, by what I can hear. As I said when Mr. Baldwin, the\r\ntax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and says, ‘Bulstrode\r\ngot all his money as he brought into this town by thieving and\r\nswindling,’—I said, ‘You don’t make me no wiser, Mr. Baldwin: it’s set\r\nmy blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here he came into\r\nSlaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my head: folks don’t\r\nlook the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you as if they wanted to\r\nsee into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was what I said, and Mr.\r\nBaldwin can bear me witness.”\r\n\r\n“And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe. “For by what I can make\r\nout, this Raffles, as they call him, was a lusty, fresh-colored man as\r\nyou’d wish to see, and the best o’ company—though dead he lies in\r\nLowick churchyard sure enough; and by what I can understan’, there’s\r\nthem knows more than they _should_ know about how he got there.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll believe you!” said Mrs. Dollop, with a touch of scorn at Mr.\r\nCrabbe’s apparent dimness. “When a man’s been ’ticed to a lone house,\r\nand there’s them can pay for hospitals and nurses for half the\r\ncountry-side choose to be sitters-up night and day, and nobody to come\r\nnear but a doctor as is known to stick at nothingk, and as poor as he\r\ncan hang together, and after that so flush o’ money as he can pay off\r\nMr. Byles the butcher as his bill has been running on for the best o’\r\njoints since last Michaelmas was a twelvemonth—I don’t want anybody to\r\ncome and tell me as there’s been more going on nor the Prayer-book’s\r\ngot a service for—I don’t want to stand winking and blinking and\r\nthinking.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Dollop looked round with the air of a landlady accustomed to\r\ndominate her company. There was a chorus of adhesion from the more\r\ncourageous; but Mr. Limp, after taking a draught, placed his flat hands\r\ntogether and pressed them hard between his knees, looking down at them\r\nwith blear-eyed contemplation, as if the scorching power of Mrs.\r\nDollop’s speech had quite dried up and nullified his wits until they\r\ncould be brought round again by further moisture.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t they dig the man up and have the Crowner?” said the\r\ndyer. “It’s been done many and many’s the time. If there’s been foul\r\nplay they might find it out.”\r\n\r\n“Not they, Mr. Jonas!” said Mrs Dollop, emphatically. “I know what\r\ndoctors are. They’re a deal too cunning to be found out. And this\r\nDoctor Lydgate that’s been for cutting up everybody before the breath\r\nwas well out o’ their body—it’s plain enough what use he wanted to make\r\no’ looking into respectable people’s insides. He knows drugs, you may\r\nbe sure, as you can neither smell nor see, neither before they’re\r\nswallowed nor after. Why, I’ve seen drops myself ordered by Doctor\r\nGambit, as is our club doctor and a good charikter, and has brought\r\nmore live children into the world nor ever another i’ Middlemarch—I say\r\nI’ve seen drops myself as made no difference whether they was in the\r\nglass or out, and yet have griped you the next day. So I’ll leave your\r\nown sense to judge. Don’t tell me! All I say is, it’s a mercy they\r\ndidn’t take this Doctor Lydgate on to our club. There’s many a mother’s\r\nchild might ha’ rued it.”\r\n\r\nThe heads of this discussion at “Dollop’s” had been the common theme\r\namong all classes in the town, had been carried to Lowick Parsonage on\r\none side and to Tipton Grange on the other, had come fully to the ears\r\nof the Vincy family, and had been discussed with sad reference to “poor\r\nHarriet” by all Mrs. Bulstrode’s friends, before Lydgate knew\r\ndistinctly why people were looking strangely at him, and before\r\nBulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his secrets. He had not\r\nbeen accustomed to very cordial relations with his neighbors, and hence\r\nhe could not miss the signs of cordiality; moreover, he had been taking\r\njourneys on business of various kinds, having now made up his mind that\r\nhe need not quit Middlemarch, and feeling able consequently to\r\ndetermine on matters which he had before left in suspense.\r\n\r\n“We will make a journey to Cheltenham in the course of a month or two,”\r\nhe had said to his wife. “There are great spiritual advantages to be\r\nhad in that town along with the air and the waters, and six weeks there\r\nwill be eminently refreshing to us.”\r\n\r\nHe really believed in the spiritual advantages, and meant that his life\r\nhenceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which\r\nhe represented to himself as hypothetic, praying hypothetically for\r\ntheir pardon:—“if I have herein transgressed.”\r\n\r\nAs to the Hospital, he avoided saying anything further to Lydgate,\r\nfearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the\r\ndeath of Raffles. In his secret soul he believed that Lydgate suspected\r\nhis orders to have been intentionally disobeyed, and suspecting this he\r\nmust also suspect a motive. But nothing had been betrayed to him as to\r\nthe history of Raffles, and Bulstrode was anxious not to do anything\r\nwhich would give emphasis to his undefined suspicions. As to any\r\ncertainty that a particular method of treatment would either save or\r\nkill, Lydgate himself was constantly arguing against such dogmatism; he\r\nhad no right to speak, and he had every motive for being silent. Hence\r\nBulstrode felt himself providentially secured. The only incident he had\r\nstrongly winced under had been an occasional encounter with Caleb\r\nGarth, who, however, had raised his hat with mild gravity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the part of the principal townsmen a strong determination\r\nwas growing against him.\r\n\r\nA meeting was to be held in the Town-Hall on a sanitary question which\r\nhad risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a cholera case\r\nin the town. Since the Act of Parliament, which had been hurriedly\r\npassed, authorizing assessments for sanitary measures, there had been a\r\nBoard for the superintendence of such measures appointed in\r\nMiddlemarch, and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in\r\nby Whigs and Tories. The question now was, whether a piece of ground\r\noutside the town should be secured as a burial-ground by means of\r\nassessment or by private subscription. The meeting was to be open, and\r\nalmost everybody of importance in the town was expected to be there.\r\n\r\nMr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board, and just before twelve o’clock\r\nhe started from the Bank with the intention of urging the plan of\r\nprivate subscription. Under the hesitation of his projects, he had for\r\nsome time kept himself in the background, and he felt that he should\r\nthis morning resume his old position as a man of action and influence\r\nin the public affairs of the town where he expected to end his days.\r\nAmong the various persons going in the same direction, he saw Lydgate;\r\nthey joined, talked over the object of the meeting, and entered it\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they. But there\r\nwere still spaces left near the head of the large central table, and\r\nthey made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat opposite, not far from\r\nMr. Hawley; all the medical men were there; Mr. Thesiger was in the\r\nchair, and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his right hand.\r\n\r\nLydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and Bulstrode\r\ntook their seats.\r\n\r\nAfter the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who pointed\r\nout the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground\r\nlarge enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery, Mr.\r\nBulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent voice the\r\ntown was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked leave to\r\ndeliver his opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange\r\nof glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in his firm resonant\r\nvoice, “Mr. Chairman, I request that before any one delivers his\r\nopinion on this point I may be permitted to speak on a question of\r\npublic feeling, which not only by myself, but by many gentlemen\r\npresent, is regarded as preliminary.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley’s mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed his\r\n“awful language,” was formidable in its curtness and self-possession.\r\nMr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode sat down, and Mr.\r\nHawley continued.\r\n\r\n“In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply on my\r\nown behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the express\r\nrequest of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who are\r\nimmediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr. Bulstrode\r\nshould be called upon—and I do now call upon him—to resign public\r\npositions which he holds not simply as a tax-payer, but as a gentleman\r\namong gentlemen. There are practices and there are acts which, owing to\r\ncircumstances, the law cannot visit, though they may be worse than many\r\nthings which are legally punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if they\r\ndon’t want the company of people who perpetrate such acts, have got to\r\ndefend themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the friends\r\nwhom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do. I don’t\r\nsay that Mr. Bulstrode has been guilty of shameful acts, but I call\r\nupon him either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous statements\r\nmade against him by a man now dead, and who died in his house—the\r\nstatement that he was for many years engaged in nefarious practices,\r\nand that he won his fortune by dishonest procedures—or else to withdraw\r\nfrom positions which could only have been allowed him as a gentleman\r\namong gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since the first\r\nmention of his name, had been going through a crisis of feeling almost\r\ntoo violent for his delicate frame to support. Lydgate, who himself was\r\nundergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of\r\nsome faint augury, felt, nevertheless, that his own movement of\r\nresentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which\r\nthinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer, when he\r\nlooked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode’s livid face.\r\n\r\nThe quick vision that his life was after all a failure, that he was a\r\ndishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those towards whom\r\nhe had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover—that God had\r\ndisowned him before men and left him unscreened to the triumphant scorn\r\nof those who were glad to have their hatred justified—the sense of\r\nutter futility in that equivocation with his conscience in dealing with\r\nthe life of his accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously\r\nupon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed\r\nthrough him like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and leaves\r\nthe ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The sudden\r\nsense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety came—not to\r\nthe coarse organization of a criminal, but to the susceptible nerve of\r\na man whose intensest being lay in such mastery and predominance as the\r\nconditions of his life had shaped for him.\r\n\r\nBut in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through all his\r\nbodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious\r\nself-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,\r\nscattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat an object\r\nof compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under\r\nhis ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley’s\r\nmouth, Bulstrode felt that he should answer, and that his answer would\r\nbe a retort. He dared not get up and say, “I am not guilty, the whole\r\nstory is false”—even if he had dared this, it would have seemed to him,\r\nunder his present keen sense of betrayal, as vain as to pull, for\r\ncovering to his nakedness, a frail rag which would rend at every little\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was total silence, while every man in the room\r\nwas looking at Bulstrode. He sat perfectly still, leaning hard against\r\nthe back of his chair; he could not venture to rise, and when he began\r\nto speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him. But\r\nhis voice was perfectly audible, though hoarser than usual, and his\r\nwords were distinctly pronounced, though he paused between sentence as\r\nif short of breath. He said, turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and\r\nthen looking at Mr. Hawley—\r\n\r\n“I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the\r\nsanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent\r\nhatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel\r\nuttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become\r\nstrict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be made\r\nthe victim accuses me of malpractices—” here Bulstrode’s voice rose and\r\ntook on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low cry—“who shall be my\r\naccuser? Not men whose own lives are unchristian, nay, scandalous—not\r\nmen who themselves use low instruments to carry out their ends—whose\r\nprofession is a tissue of chicanery—who have been spending their income\r\non their own sensual enjoyments, while I have been devoting mine to\r\nadvance the best objects with regard to this life and the next.”\r\n\r\nAfter the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of murmurs and\r\nhalf of hisses, while four persons started up at once—Mr. Hawley, Mr.\r\nToller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but Mr. Hawley’s outburst was\r\ninstantaneous, and left the others behind in silence.\r\n\r\n“If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the inspection\r\nof my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian, I repudiate\r\nyour canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way in which I\r\nspend my income, it is not my principle to maintain thieves and cheat\r\noffspring of their due inheritance in order to support religion and set\r\nmyself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect no niceness of conscience—I\r\nhave not found any nice standards necessary yet to measure your actions\r\nby, sir. And I again call upon you to enter into satisfactory\r\nexplanations concerning the scandals against you, or else to withdraw\r\nfrom posts in which we at any rate decline you as a colleague. I say,\r\nsir, we decline to co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared\r\nfrom infamous lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent\r\nactions.”\r\n\r\n“Allow me, Mr. Hawley,” said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still\r\nfuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his hands thrust deep\r\nin his pockets.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the present\r\ndiscussion,” said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid trembling man; “I\r\nmust so far concur with what has fallen from Mr. Hawley in expression\r\nof a general feeling, as to think it due to your Christian profession\r\nthat you should clear yourself, if possible, from unhappy aspersions. I\r\nfor my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and hearing.\r\nBut I must say that your present attitude is painfully inconsistent\r\nwith those principles which you have sought to identify yourself with,\r\nand for the honor of which I am bound to care. I recommend you at\r\npresent, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in\r\nrespect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”\r\n\r\nBulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the floor and\r\nslowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that\r\nLydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away\r\nwithout support. What could he do? He could not see a man sink close to\r\nhim for want of help. He rose and gave his arm to Bulstrode, and in\r\nthat way led him out of the room; yet this act, which might have been\r\none of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at this moment unspeakably\r\nbitter to him. It seemed as if he were putting his sign-manual to that\r\nassociation of himself with Bulstrode, of which he now saw the full\r\nmeaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He now felt\r\nthe conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm,\r\nhad given him the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the\r\ntreatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The\r\ninferences were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan,\r\nbelieved it to be a bribe, and believed that he took it as a bribe.\r\n\r\nPoor Lydgate, his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this\r\nrevelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to\r\nthe Bank, send a man off for his carriage, and wait to accompany him\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and fringed off\r\ninto eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of\r\nBulstrode—and Lydgate.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and was\r\nvery uneasy that he had “gone a little too far” in countenancing\r\nBulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent\r\nsadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which\r\nLydgate had come to be regarded. Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back\r\nto Lowick.\r\n\r\n“Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke. “I am going round to see Mrs.\r\nCasaubon. She was to come back from Yorkshire last night. She will like\r\nto see me, you know.”\r\n\r\nSo they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope that\r\nthere had not really been anything black in Lydgate’s behavior—a young\r\nfellow whom he had seen to be quite above the common mark, when he\r\nbrought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin. Mr. Farebrother said\r\nlittle: he was deeply mournful: with a keen perception of human\r\nweakness, he could not be confident that under the pressure of\r\nhumiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea was out\r\non the gravel, and came to greet them.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have just come from a meeting—a\r\nsanitary meeting, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Was Mr. Lydgate there?” said Dorothea, who looked full of health and\r\nanimation, and stood with her head bare under the gleaming April\r\nlights. “I want to see him and have a great consultation with him about\r\nthe Hospital. I have engaged with Mr. Bulstrode to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have been hearing bad news—bad\r\nnews, you know.”\r\n\r\nThey walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.\r\nFarebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard the\r\nwhole sad story.\r\n\r\nShe listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over the\r\nfacts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short silence,\r\npausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr. Farebrother, she\r\nsaid energetically—\r\n\r\n“You don’t believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base? I will\r\nnot believe it. Let us find out the truth and clear him!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\nSUNSET AND SUNRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nFull souls are double mirrors, making still\r\nAn endless vista of fair things before,\r\nRepeating things behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea’s impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once to the\r\nvindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a\r\nbribe, underwent a melancholy check when she came to consider all the\r\ncircumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother’s experience.\r\n\r\n“It is a delicate matter to touch,” he said. “How can we begin to\r\ninquire into it? It must be either publicly by setting the magistrate\r\nand coroner to work, or privately by questioning Lydgate. As to the\r\nfirst proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon, else Hawley would\r\nhave adopted it; and as to opening the subject with Lydgate, I confess\r\nI should shrink from it. He would probably take it as a deadly insult.\r\nI have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to him on\r\npersonal matters. And—one should know the truth about his conduct\r\nbeforehand, to feel very confident of a good result.”\r\n\r\n“I feel convinced that his conduct has not been guilty: I believe that\r\npeople are almost always better than their neighbors think they are,”\r\nsaid Dorothea. Some of her intensest experience in the last two years\r\nhad set her mind strongly in opposition to any unfavorable construction\r\nof others; and for the first time she felt rather discontented with Mr.\r\nFarebrother. She disliked this cautious weighing of consequences,\r\ninstead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy, which would\r\nconquer by their emotional force. Two days afterwards, he was dining at\r\nthe Manor with her uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was\r\nstanding uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was\r\nnodding in a nap, she returned to the subject with renewed vivacity.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate would understand that if his friends hear a calumny about\r\nhim their first wish must be to justify him. What do we live for, if it\r\nis not to make life less difficult to each other? I cannot be\r\nindifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in _my_ trouble,\r\nand attended me in my illness.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been\r\nwhen she was at the head of her uncle’s table nearly three years\r\nbefore, and her experience since had given her more right to express a\r\ndecided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and\r\nacquiescent suitor: he was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout\r\nadmiration for his sister, but with a constant alarm lest she should\r\nfall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. He\r\nsmiled much less; when he said “Exactly” it was more often an\r\nintroduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor\r\ndays; and Dorothea found to her surprise that she had to resolve not to\r\nbe afraid of him—all the more because he was really her best friend. He\r\ndisagreed with her now.\r\n\r\n“But, Dorothea,” he said, remonstrantly, “you can’t undertake to manage\r\na man’s life for him in that way. Lydgate must know—at least he will\r\nsoon come to know how he stands. If he can clear himself, he will. He\r\nmust act for himself.”\r\n\r\n“I think his friends must wait till they find an opportunity,” added\r\nMr. Farebrother. “It is possible—I have often felt so much weakness in\r\nmyself that I can conceive even a man of honorable disposition, such as\r\nI have always believed Lydgate to be, succumbing to such a temptation\r\nas that of accepting money which was offered more or less indirectly as\r\na bribe to insure his silence about scandalous facts long gone by. I\r\nsay, I can conceive this, if he were under the pressure of hard\r\ncircumstances—if he had been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has been.\r\nI would not believe anything worse of him except under stringent proof.\r\nBut there is the terrible Nemesis following on some errors, that it is\r\nalways possible for those who like it to interpret them into a crime:\r\nthere is no proof in favor of the man outside his own consciousness and\r\nassertion.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how cruel!” said Dorothea, clasping her hands. “And would you not\r\nlike to be the one person who believed in that man’s innocence, if the\r\nrest of the world belied him? Besides, there is a man’s character\r\nbeforehand to speak for him.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at\r\nher ardor, “character is not cut in marble—it is not something solid\r\nand unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become\r\ndiseased as our bodies do.”\r\n\r\n“Then it may be rescued and healed,” said Dorothea “I should not be\r\nafraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might help\r\nhim. Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the land, James,\r\nI might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take his place in providing\r\nfor the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr. Lydgate, to know thoroughly\r\nwhat are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the present plans.\r\nThere is the best opportunity in the world for me to ask for his\r\nconfidence; and he would be able to tell me things which might make all\r\nthe circumstances clear. Then we would all stand by him and bring him\r\nout of his trouble. People glorify all sorts of bravery except the\r\nbravery they might show on behalf of their nearest neighbors.”\r\nDorothea’s eyes had a moist brightness in them, and the changed tones\r\nof her voice roused her uncle, who began to listen.\r\n\r\n“It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which\r\nwould hardly succeed if we men undertook them,” said Mr. Farebrother,\r\nalmost converted by Dorothea’s ardor.\r\n\r\n“Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know\r\nthe world better than she does.” said Sir James, with his little frown.\r\n“Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at\r\npresent, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business.\r\nWe don’t know yet what may turn up. You must agree with me?” he ended,\r\nlooking at Mr. Farebrother.\r\n\r\n“I do think it would be better to wait,” said the latter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, not quite knowing at what point\r\nthe discussion had arrived, but coming up to it with a contribution\r\nwhich was generally appropriate. “It is easy to go too far, you know.\r\nYou must not let your ideas run away with you. And as to being in a\r\nhurry to put money into schemes—it won’t do, you know. Garth has drawn\r\nme in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that sort of thing: I’m\r\nuncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another. I must pull up. As\r\nfor you, Chettam, you are spending a fortune on those oak fences round\r\nyour demesne.”\r\n\r\nDorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with Celia\r\ninto the library, which was her usual drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“Now, Dodo, do listen to what James says,” said Celia, “else you will\r\nbe getting into a scrape. You always did, and you always will, when you\r\nset about doing as you please. And I think it is a mercy now after all\r\nthat you have got James to think for you. He lets you have your plans,\r\nonly he hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having\r\na brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your\r\nplans.”\r\n\r\n“As if I wanted a husband!” said Dorothea. “I only want not to have my\r\nfeelings checked at every turn.” Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined\r\nenough to burst into angry tears.\r\n\r\n“Now, really, Dodo,” said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural than\r\nusual, “you _are_ contradictory: first one thing and then another. You\r\nused to submit to Mr. Casaubon quite shamefully: I think you would have\r\ngiven up ever coming to see me if he had asked you.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my\r\nfeeling for him,” said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n“Then why can’t you think it your duty to submit a little to what James\r\nwishes?” said Celia, with a sense of stringency in her argument.\r\n“Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And, of course, men\r\nknow best about everything, except what women know better.” Dorothea\r\nlaughed and forgot her tears.\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean about babies and those things,” explained Celia. “I\r\nshould not give up to James when I knew he was wrong, as you used to do\r\nto Mr. Casaubon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nPity the laden one; this wandering woe\r\nMay visit you and me.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode’s anxiety by telling her that\r\nher husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but that he\r\ntrusted soon to see him better and would call again the next day,\r\nunless she sent for him earlier, he went directly home, got on his\r\nhorse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out\r\nof reach.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under\r\nthe pain of stings: he was ready to curse the day on which he had come\r\nto Middlemarch. Everything that bad happened to him there seemed a mere\r\npreparation for this hateful fatality, which had come as a blight on\r\nhis honorable ambition, and must make even people who had only vulgar\r\nstandards regard his reputation as irrevocably damaged. In such moments\r\na man can hardly escape being unloving. Lydgate thought of himself as\r\nthe sufferer, and of others as the agents who had injured his lot. He\r\nhad meant everything to turn out differently; and others had thrust\r\nthemselves into his life and thwarted his purposes. His marriage seemed\r\nan unmitigated calamity; and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before\r\nhe had vented himself in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of her\r\nshould exasperate him and make him behave unwarrantably. There are\r\nepisodes in most men’s lives in which their highest qualities can only\r\ncast a deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision:\r\nLydgate’s tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread lest\r\nhe should offend against it, not as an emotion that swayed him to\r\ntenderness. For he was very miserable. Only those who know the\r\nsupremacy of the intellectual life—the life which has a seed of\r\nennobling thought and purpose within it—can understand the grief of one\r\nwho falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting\r\nstruggle with worldly annoyances.\r\n\r\nHow was he to live on without vindicating himself among people who\r\nsuspected him of baseness? How could he go silently away from\r\nMiddlemarch as if he were retreating before a just condemnation? And\r\nyet how was he to set about vindicating himself?\r\n\r\nFor that scene at the meeting, which he had just witnessed, although it\r\nhad told him no particulars, had been enough to make his own situation\r\nthoroughly clear to him. Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous\r\ndisclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate could now construct all the\r\nprobabilities of the case. “He was afraid of some betrayal in my\r\nhearing: all he wanted was to bind me to him by a strong obligation:\r\nthat was why he passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality. And he\r\nmay have tampered with the patient—he may have disobeyed my orders. I\r\nfear he did. But whether he did or not, the world believes that he\r\nsomehow or other poisoned the man and that I winked at the crime, if I\r\ndidn’t help in it. And yet—and yet he may not be guilty of the last\r\noffence; and it is just possible that the change towards me may have\r\nbeen a genuine relenting—the effect of second thoughts such as he\r\nalleged. What we call the ‘just possible’ is sometimes true and the\r\nthing we find it easier to believe is grossly false. In his last\r\ndealings with this man Bulstrode may have kept his hands pure, in spite\r\nof my suspicion to the contrary.”\r\n\r\nThere was a benumbing cruelty in his position. Even if he renounced\r\nevery other consideration than that of justifying himself—if he met\r\nshrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an accusation, and made a public\r\nstatement of all the facts as he knew them, who would be convinced? It\r\nwould be playing the part of a fool to offer his own testimony on\r\nbehalf of himself, and say, “I did not take the money as a bribe.” The\r\ncircumstances would always be stronger than his assertion. And besides,\r\nto come forward and tell everything about himself must include\r\ndeclarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of\r\nothers against him. He must tell that he had not known of Raffles’s\r\nexistence when he first mentioned his pressing need of money to\r\nBulstrode, and that he took the money innocently as a result of that\r\ncommunication, not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have\r\narisen on his being called in to this man. And after all, the suspicion\r\nof Bulstrode’s motives might be unjust.\r\n\r\nBut then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely\r\nthe same way if he had not taken the money? Certainly, if Raffles had\r\ncontinued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived,\r\nand he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of\r\nBulstrode, he would have made a strict inquiry, and if his conjecture\r\nhad been verified he would have thrown up the case, in spite of his\r\nrecent heavy obligation. But if he had not received any money—if\r\nBulstrode had never revoked his cold recommendation of bankruptcy—would\r\nhe, Lydgate, have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the man\r\ndead?—would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode—would the\r\ndubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that his own\r\ntreatment would pass for the wrong with most members of his\r\nprofession—have had just the same force or significance with him?\r\n\r\nThat was the uneasy corner of Lydgate’s consciousness while he was\r\nreviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If he had been\r\nindependent, this matter of a patient’s treatment and the distinct rule\r\nthat he must do or see done that which he believed best for the life\r\ncommitted to him, would have been the point on which he would have been\r\nthe sturdiest. As it was, he had rested in the consideration that\r\ndisobedience to his orders, however it might have arisen, could not be\r\nconsidered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his\r\norders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply\r\none of etiquette. Whereas, again and again, in his time of freedom, he\r\nhad denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and\r\nhad said—“the purest experiment in treatment may still be\r\nconscientious: my business is to take care of life, and to do the best\r\nI can think of for it. Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma.\r\nDogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a\r\ncontest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.” Alas! the\r\nscientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money\r\nobligation and selfish respects.\r\n\r\n“Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question\r\nhimself as I do?” said poor Lydgate, with a renewed outburst of\r\nrebellion against the oppression of his lot. “And yet they will all\r\nfeel warranted in making a wide space between me and them, as if I were\r\na leper! My practice and my reputation are utterly damned—I can see\r\nthat. Even if I could be cleared by valid evidence, it would make\r\nlittle difference to the blessed world here. I have been set down as\r\ntainted and should be cheapened to them all the same.”\r\n\r\nAlready there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him,\r\nthat just when he had been paying off his debts and getting cheerfully\r\non his feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at\r\nhim, and in two instances it came to his knowledge that patients of his\r\nhad called in another practitioner. The reasons were too plain now. The\r\ngeneral black-balling had begun.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that in Lydgate’s energetic nature the sense of a hopeless\r\nmisconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which\r\noccasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless\r\naccident. Already when he was re-entering the town after that ride\r\ntaken in the first hours of stinging pain, he was setting his mind on\r\nremaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done\r\nagainst him. He would not retreat before calumny, as if he submitted to\r\nit. He would face it to the utmost, and no act of his should show that\r\nhe was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force\r\nof his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full\r\nhis sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association\r\nwith this man had been fatal to him—true that if he had had the\r\nthousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would\r\nhave returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the\r\nrescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for,\r\nremember, he was one of the proudest among the sons of\r\nmen)—nevertheless, he would not turn away from this crushed\r\nfellow-mortal whose aid he had used, and make a pitiful effort to get\r\nacquittal for himself by howling against another. “I shall do as I\r\nthink right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out,\r\nbut—” he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was getting\r\nnear home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that\r\nchief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of\r\nwounded honor and pride.\r\n\r\nHow would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain to\r\ndrag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her dumb mastery.\r\nHe had no impulse to tell her the trouble which must soon be common to\r\nthem both. He preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which\r\nevents must soon bring about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\n“Mercifully grant that we may grow aged together.”\r\n—BOOK OF TOBIT: _Marriage Prayer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held\r\na bad opinion of her husband. No feminine intimate might carry her\r\nfriendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the\r\nunpleasant fact known or believed about her husband; but when a woman\r\nwith her thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on\r\nsomething grievously disadvantageous to her neighbors, various moral\r\nimpulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance.\r\nCandor was one. To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to use\r\nan early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take\r\na cheerful view of their capacity, their conduct, or their position;\r\nand a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion. Then,\r\nagain, there was the love of truth—a wide phrase, but meaning in this\r\nrelation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her\r\nhusband’s character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in her\r\nlot—the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew the\r\ntruth she would have less complacency in her bonnet, and in light\r\ndishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the regard for\r\na friend’s moral improvement, sometimes called her soul, which was\r\nlikely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom, uttered with the\r\naccompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner implying\r\nthat the speaker would not tell what was on her mind, from regard to\r\nthe feelings of her hearer. On the whole, one might say that an ardent\r\ncharity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a neighbor\r\nunhappy for her good.\r\n\r\nThere were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial\r\nmisfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of\r\nthis moral activity than Rosamond and her aunt Bulstrode. Mrs.\r\nBulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously\r\ninjured any human being. Men had always thought her a handsome\r\ncomfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode’s\r\nhypocrisy that he had chosen a red-blooded Vincy, instead of a ghastly\r\nand melancholy person suited to his low esteem for earthly pleasure.\r\nWhen the scandal about her husband was disclosed they remarked of\r\nher—“Ah, poor woman! She’s as honest as the day—_she_ never suspected\r\nanything wrong in him, you may depend on it.” Women, who were intimate\r\nwith her, talked together much of “poor Harriet,” imagined what her\r\nfeelings must be when she came to know everything, and conjectured how\r\nmuch she had already come to know. There was no spiteful disposition\r\ntowards her; rather, there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain\r\nwhat it would be well for her to feel and do under the circumstances,\r\nwhich of course kept the imagination occupied with her character and\r\nhistory from the times when she was Harriet Vincy till now. With the\r\nreview of Mrs. Bulstrode and her position it was inevitable to\r\nassociate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same blight with her\r\naunt’s. Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied, though\r\nshe too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known\r\nin Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage with an\r\ninterloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they lay on the\r\nsurface: there was never anything bad to be “found out” concerning\r\nthem. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance to her\r\nhusband. Harriet’s faults were her own.\r\n\r\n“She has always been showy,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, making tea for a small\r\nparty, “though she has got into the way of putting her religion\r\nforward, to conform to her husband; she has tried to hold her head up\r\nabove Middlemarch by making it known that she invites clergymen and\r\nheaven-knows-who from Riverston and those places.”\r\n\r\n“We can hardly blame her for that,” said Mrs. Sprague; “because few of\r\nthe best people in the town cared to associate with Bulstrode, and she\r\nmust have somebody to sit down at her table.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Thesiger has always countenanced him,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I\r\nthink he must be sorry now.”\r\n\r\n“But he was never fond of him in his heart—that every one knows,” said\r\nMrs. Tom Toller. “Mr. Thesiger never goes into extremes. He keeps to\r\nthe truth in what is evangelical. It is only clergymen like Mr. Tyke,\r\nwho want to use Dissenting hymn-books and that low kind of religion,\r\nwho ever found Bulstrode to their taste.”\r\n\r\n“I understand, Mr. Tyke is in great distress about him,” said Mrs.\r\nHackbutt. “And well he may be: they say the Bulstrodes have half kept\r\nthe Tyke family.”\r\n\r\n“And of course it is a discredit to his doctrines,” said Mrs. Sprague,\r\nwho was elderly, and old-fashioned in her opinions.\r\n\r\n“People will not make a boast of being methodistical in Middlemarch for\r\na good while to come.”\r\n\r\n“I think we must not set down people’s bad actions to their religion,”\r\nsaid falcon-faced Mrs. Plymdale, who had been listening hitherto.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, we are forgetting,” said Mrs. Sprague. “We ought not to\r\nbe talking of this before you.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I have no reason to be partial,” said Mrs. Plymdale,\r\ncoloring. “It’s true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms with\r\nMr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she married\r\nhim. But I have always kept my own opinions and told her where she was\r\nwrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I must say, Mr.\r\nBulstrode might have done what he has, and worse, and yet have been a\r\nman of no religion. I don’t say that there has not been a little too\r\nmuch of that—I like moderation myself. But truth is truth. The men\r\ntried at the assizes are not all over-religious, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, “all I can say is, that\r\nI think she ought to separate from him.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say that,” said Mrs. Sprague. “She took him for better or\r\nworse, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But ‘worse’ can never mean finding out that your husband is fit for\r\nNewgate,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “Fancy living with such a man! I should\r\nexpect to be poisoned.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think myself it is an encouragement to crime if such men are to\r\nbe taken care of and waited on by good wives,” said Mrs. Tom Toller.\r\n\r\n“And a good wife poor Harriet has been,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “She\r\nthinks her husband the first of men. It’s true he has never denied her\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall see what she will do,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I suppose\r\nshe knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I shall not\r\nsee her, for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything\r\nabout her husband. Do you think any hint has reached her?”\r\n\r\n“I should hardly think so,” said Mrs. Tom Toller. “We hear that _he_ is\r\nill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on\r\nThursday; but she was with her girls at church yesterday, and they had\r\nnew Tuscan bonnets. Her own had a feather in it. I have never seen that\r\nher religion made any difference in her dress.”\r\n\r\n“She wears very neat patterns always,” said Mrs. Plymdale, a little\r\nstung. “And that feather I know she got dyed a pale lavender on purpose\r\nto be consistent. I must say it of Harriet that she wishes to do\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“As to her knowing what has happened, it can’t be kept from her long,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Hackbutt. “The Vincys know, for Mr. Vincy was at the meeting.\r\nIt will be a great blow to him. There is his daughter as well as his\r\nsister.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Sprague. “Nobody supposes that Mr. Lydgate can\r\ngo on holding up his head in Middlemarch, things look so black about\r\nthe thousand pounds he took just at that man’s death. It really makes\r\none shudder.”\r\n\r\n“Pride must have a fall,” said Mrs. Hackbutt.\r\n\r\n“I am not so sorry for Rosamond Vincy that was as I am for her aunt,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Plymdale. “She needed a lesson.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the Bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere,” said Mrs.\r\nSprague. “That is what is generally done when there is anything\r\ndisgraceful in a family.”\r\n\r\n“And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “If\r\never a woman was crushed, she will be. I pity her from my heart. And\r\nwith all her faults, few women are better. From a girl she had the\r\nneatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You\r\nmight look into her drawers when you would—always the same. And so she\r\nhas brought up Kate and Ellen. You may think how hard it will be for\r\nher to go among foreigners.”\r\n\r\n“The doctor says that is what he should recommend the Lydgates to do,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Sprague. “He says Lydgate ought to have kept among the\r\nFrench.”\r\n\r\n“That would suit _her_ well enough, I dare say,” said Mrs. Plymdale;\r\n“there is that kind of lightness about her. But she got that from her\r\nmother; she never got it from her aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her\r\ngood advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some complication of\r\nfeeling. There had been not only her intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode, but\r\nalso a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house\r\nwith Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one hand would have inclined her to\r\ndesire that the mildest view of his character should be the true one,\r\nbut on the other, made her the more afraid of seeming to palliate his\r\nculpability. Again, the late alliance of her family with the Tollers\r\nhad brought her in connection with the best circle, which gratified her\r\nin every direction except in the inclination to those serious views\r\nwhich she believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little\r\nwoman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these\r\nopposing “bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late\r\nevents, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also\r\nto fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred\r\nseeing on a background of prosperity.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the\r\noncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret\r\nuneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of\r\nRaffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone\r\nCourt, and that her husband had chosen to remain there and watch over\r\nhim, she allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been\r\nemployed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of\r\nbenevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness; and she had been\r\nsince then innocently cheered by her husband’s more hopeful speech\r\nabout his own health and ability to continue his attention to business.\r\nThe calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the\r\nmeeting, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few\r\ndays, she cried in private from the conviction that her husband was not\r\nsuffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted\r\nhis mind. He would not allow her to read to him, and scarcely to sit\r\nwith him, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet\r\nshe suspected that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted\r\nto be busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had happened.\r\nPerhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the dark.\r\nNot daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on the fifth\r\nday after the meeting, when she had not left home except to go to\r\nchurch—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has\r\nanything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?”\r\n\r\n“Some little nervous shock,” said Lydgate, evasively. He felt that it\r\nwas not for him to make the painful revelation.\r\n\r\n“But what brought it on?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at him\r\nwith her large dark eyes.\r\n\r\n“There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms,” said\r\nLydgate. “Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people in proportion\r\nto the delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible to account for\r\nthe precise moment of an attack—or rather, to say why the strength\r\ngives way at a particular moment.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in\r\nher the belief that some calamity had befallen her husband, of which\r\nshe was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in her nature strongly to\r\nobject to such concealment. She begged leave for her daughters to sit\r\nwith their father, and drove into the town to pay some visits,\r\nconjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr.\r\nBulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear some sign of it.\r\n\r\nShe called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to\r\nMrs. Hackbutt’s on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw\r\nher coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering her former alarm\r\nlest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency\r\nto send word that she was not at home; but against that, there was a\r\nsudden strong desire within her for the excitement of an interview in\r\nwhich she was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to\r\nwhat was in her mind.\r\n\r\nHence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt\r\nwent to her, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her hands than\r\nwas usually observable in her, these being precautions adopted against\r\nfreedom of speech. She was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was.\r\n\r\n“I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,” said\r\nMrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. “But Mr. Bulstrode\r\nwas taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have not liked to\r\nleave the house.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other\r\nheld against her chest, and let her eyes ramble over the pattern on the\r\nrug.\r\n\r\n“Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?” persevered Mrs. Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he was,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. “The land is\r\nto be bought by subscription, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried\r\nin it,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “It is an awful visitation. But I always\r\nthink Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to it\r\nfrom a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at better,\r\nand especially our end.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch,\r\nMrs. Bulstrode,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. “Still, we\r\nmust learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot may be cast. Though I\r\nam sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hackbutt longed to say, “if you take my advice you will part from\r\nyour husband,” but it seemed clear to her that the poor woman knew\r\nnothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head, and she herself could\r\ndo no more than prepare her a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly\r\nrather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual\r\nbehind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s; but though she had set out with\r\nthe desire to be fully informed, she found herself unable now to pursue\r\nher brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the\r\nyoung Hackbutts, she soon took her leave saying that she was going to\r\nsee Mrs. Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that there\r\nmight have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.\r\nBulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might\r\nhave been one of them. That would account for everything.\r\n\r\nBut when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting\r\nexplanation seemed no longer tenable. “Selina” received her with a\r\npathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on\r\nthe commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary\r\nquarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of\r\nMr. Bulstrode’s health. Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she\r\nwould sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to\r\nher surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is\r\neasiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered\r\ncommunication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being\r\npitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the\r\nsuperiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs.\r\nPlymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her\r\nfriends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some\r\nkind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native\r\ndirectness, “What is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself\r\nanxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit. She\r\nbegan to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something\r\nmore than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact\r\nthat Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided\r\nnoticing what she said about her husband, as they would have avoided\r\nnoticing a personal blemish.\r\n\r\nShe said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to\r\nMr. Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread gathered so much\r\nforce from the sense of darkness, that when she entered the private\r\ncounting-house where her brother sat at his desk, her knees trembled\r\nand her usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same\r\neffect was produced in him by the sight of her: he rose from his seat\r\nto meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with his impulsive\r\nrashness—\r\n\r\n“God help you, Harriet! you know all.”\r\n\r\nThat moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained\r\nthat concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals\r\nthe bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will\r\nend an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she might\r\nstill have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her\r\nbrother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some\r\nguilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image\r\nof her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of\r\nscorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one\r\nleap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching\r\nfellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her in a\r\nmere flash of time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes\r\nto her brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is\r\nit?” she said, faintly.\r\n\r\nHe told her everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making\r\nher aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the\r\nend of Raffles.\r\n\r\n“People will talk,” he said. “Even if a man has been acquitted by a\r\njury, they’ll talk, and nod and wink—and as far as the world goes, a\r\nman might often as well be guilty as not. It’s a breakdown blow, and it\r\ndamages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend to say what is\r\nthe truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either Bulstrode\r\nor Lydgate. You’d better have been a Vincy all your life, and so had\r\nRosamond.” Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.\r\n\r\n“But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don’t blame\r\n_you_. And I’ll stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do,”\r\nsaid the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness.\r\n\r\n“Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “I\r\nfeel very weak.”\r\n\r\nAnd when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter, “I am not\r\nwell, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in\r\nquiet. I shall take no dinner.”\r\n\r\nShe locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to her\r\nmaimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could walk\r\nsteadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had fallen on\r\nher husband’s character, and she could not judge him leniently: the\r\ntwenty years in which she had believed in him and venerated him by\r\nvirtue of his concealments came back with particulars that made them\r\nseem an odious deceit. He had married her with that bad past life\r\nhidden behind him, and she had no faith left to protest his innocence\r\nof the worst that was imputed to him. Her honest ostentatious nature\r\nmade the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any\r\nmortal.\r\n\r\nBut this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd\r\npatchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose prosperity she\r\nhad shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly\r\ncherished her—now that punishment had befallen him it was not possible\r\nto her in any sense to forsake him. There is a forsaking which still\r\nsits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken\r\nsoul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. She knew, when she\r\nlocked her door, that she should unlock it ready to go down to her\r\nunhappy husband and espouse his sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will\r\nmourn and not reproach. But she needed time to gather up her strength;\r\nshe needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her\r\nlife. When she had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some\r\nlittle acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were\r\nher way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she\r\nhad begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off\r\nall her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing\r\nher much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down\r\nand put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly like an\r\nearly Methodist.\r\n\r\nBulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying\r\nthat she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to\r\nhers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others, and\r\nhad acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him than any\r\nconfession. But now that he imagined the moment of her knowledge come,\r\nhe awaited the result in anguish. His daughters had been obliged to\r\nconsent to leave him, and though he had allowed some food to be brought\r\nto him, he had not touched it. He felt himself perishing slowly in\r\nunpitied misery. Perhaps he should never see his wife’s face with\r\naffection in it again. And if he turned to God there seemed to be no\r\nanswer but the pressure of retribution.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o’clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife\r\nentered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes bent down,\r\nand as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller—he seemed so\r\nwithered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old tenderness\r\nwent through her like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which\r\nrested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, she\r\nsaid, solemnly but kindly—\r\n\r\n“Look up, Nicholas.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed\r\nfor a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning dress, the trembling\r\nabout her mouth, all said, “I know;” and her hands and eyes rested\r\ngently on him. He burst out crying and they cried together, she sitting\r\nat his side. They could not yet speak to each other of the shame which\r\nshe was bearing with him, or of the acts which had brought it down on\r\nthem. His confession was silent, and her promise of faithfulness was\r\nsilent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless shrank from the words\r\nwhich would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as she would\r\nhave shrunk from flakes of fire. She could not say, “How much is only\r\nslander and false suspicion?” and he did not say, “I am innocent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\n“Le sentiment de la fausseté des plaisirs présents, et l’ignorance de\r\nla vanité des plaisirs absents causent l’inconstance.”—PASCAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nRosamond had a gleam of returning cheerfulness when the house was freed\r\nfrom the threatening figure, and when all the disagreeable creditors\r\nwere paid. But she was not joyous: her married life had fulfilled none\r\nof her hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her imagination. In this\r\nbrief interval of calm, Lydgate, remembering that he had often been\r\nstormy in his hours of perturbation, and mindful of the pain Rosamond\r\nhad had to bear, was carefully gentle towards her; but he, too, had\r\nlost some of his old spirit, and he still felt it necessary to refer to\r\nan economical change in their way of living as a matter of course,\r\ntrying to reconcile her to it gradually, and repressing his anger when\r\nshe answered by wishing that he would go to live in London. When she\r\ndid not make this answer, she listened languidly, and wondered what she\r\nhad that was worth living for. The hard and contemptuous words which\r\nhad fallen from her husband in his anger had deeply offended that\r\nvanity which he had at first called into active enjoyment; and what she\r\nregarded as his perverse way of looking at things, kept up a secret\r\nrepulsion, which made her receive all his tenderness as a poor\r\nsubstitute for the happiness he had failed to give her. They were at a\r\ndisadvantage with their neighbors, and there was no longer any outlook\r\ntowards Quallingham—there was no outlook anywhere except in an\r\noccasional letter from Will Ladislaw. She had felt stung and\r\ndisappointed by Will’s resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of\r\nwhat she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea, she\r\nsecretly cherished the belief that he had, or would necessarily come to\r\nhave, much more admiration for herself; Rosamond being one of those\r\nwomen who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have\r\npreferred them if the preference had not been hopeless. Mrs. Casaubon\r\nwas all very well; but Will’s interest in her dated before he knew Mrs.\r\nLydgate. Rosamond took his way of talking to herself, which was a\r\nmixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the\r\ndisguise of a deeper feeling; and in his presence she felt that\r\nagreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which\r\nLydgate’s presence had no longer the magic to create. She even\r\nfancied—what will not men and women fancy in these matters?—that Will\r\nexaggerated his admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique herself.\r\nIn this way poor Rosamond’s brain had been busy before Will’s\r\ndeparture. He would have made, she thought, a much more suitable\r\nhusband for her than she had found in Lydgate. No notion could have\r\nbeen falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was\r\ndue to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for\r\nself-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband;\r\nbut the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm\r\nwhich diverted her ennui. She constructed a little romance which was to\r\nvary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a\r\nbachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an\r\nunderstood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be\r\nsending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.\r\nHis departure had been a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly\r\nincreased her weariness of Middlemarch; but at first she had the\r\nalternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the\r\nfamily at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of her married life had\r\ndeepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful\r\nrumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on. Men and\r\nwomen make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague\r\nuneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and\r\noftener still for a mighty love. Will Ladislaw had written chatty\r\nletters, half to her and half to Lydgate, and she had replied: their\r\nseparation, she felt, was not likely to be final, and the change she\r\nnow most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London;\r\neverything would be agreeable in London; and she had set to work with\r\nquiet determination to win this result, when there came a sudden,\r\ndelightful promise which inspirited her.\r\n\r\nIt came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was\r\nnothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned\r\nindeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization, but\r\nmentioned incidentally, that he might find it necessary to pay a visit\r\nto Middlemarch within the next few weeks—a very pleasant necessity, he\r\nsaid, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy. He hoped there was his\r\nold place on the rug, and a great deal of music in store for him. But\r\nhe was quite uncertain as to the time. While Lydgate was reading the\r\nletter to Rosamond, her face looked like a reviving flower—it grew\r\nprettier and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable now: the\r\ndebts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be\r\npersuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London, which was “so\r\ndifferent from a provincial town.”\r\n\r\nThat was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over\r\npoor Rosamond. The presence of a new gloom in her husband, about which\r\nhe was entirely reserved towards her—for he dreaded to expose his\r\nlacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception—soon received a\r\npainfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of\r\nwhat could affect her happiness. In the new gayety of her spirits,\r\nthinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,\r\ncausing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out\r\nof her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the\r\nmeeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes\r\nof invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this\r\nwas a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof\r\nfrom them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When\r\nthe invitations had been accepted, she would tell Lydgate, and give him\r\na wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his\r\nneighbors; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about\r\nother people’s duties. But all the invitations were declined, and the\r\nlast answer came into Lydgate’s hands.\r\n\r\n“This is Chichely’s scratch. What is he writing to you about?” said\r\nLydgate, wonderingly, as he handed the note to her. She was obliged to\r\nlet him see it, and, looking at her severely, he said—\r\n\r\n“Why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me,\r\nRosamond? I beg, I insist that you will not invite any one to this\r\nhouse. I suppose you have been inviting others, and they have refused\r\ntoo.” She said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear me?” thundered Lydgate.\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly I hear you,” said Rosamond, turning her head aside with\r\nthe movement of a graceful long-necked bird.\r\n\r\nLydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room,\r\nfeeling himself dangerous. Rosamond’s thought was, that he was getting\r\nmore and more unbearable—not that there was any new special reason for\r\nthis peremptoriness. His indisposition to tell her anything in which he\r\nwas sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into\r\nan unreflecting habit, and she was in ignorance of everything connected\r\nwith the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle\r\nBulstrode. Lydgate’s odious humors and their neighbors’ apparent\r\navoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief\r\nfrom money difficulties. If the invitations had been accepted she would\r\nhave gone to invite her mamma and the rest, whom she had seen nothing\r\nof for several days; and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire\r\nwhat had become of them all, suddenly feeling as if there were a\r\nconspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend\r\neverybody. It was after the dinner hour, and she found her father and\r\nmother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They greeted her with\r\nsad looks, saying “Well, my dear!” and no more. She had never seen her\r\nfather look so downcast; and seating herself near him she said—\r\n\r\n“Is there anything the matter, papa?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but Mrs. Vincy said, “Oh, my dear, have you heard\r\nnothing? It won’t be long before it reaches you.”\r\n\r\n“Is it anything about Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning pale. The idea\r\nof trouble immediately connected itself with what had been\r\nunaccountable to her in him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, yes. To think of your marrying into this trouble. Debt\r\nwas bad enough, but this will be worse.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, stay, Lucy,” said Mr. Vincy. “Have you heard nothing about your\r\nuncle Bulstrode, Rosamond?”\r\n\r\n“No, papa,” said the poor thing, feeling as if trouble were not\r\nanything she had before experienced, but some invisible power with an\r\niron grasp that made her soul faint within her.\r\n\r\nHer father told her everything, saying at the end, “It’s better for you\r\nto know, my dear. I think Lydgate must leave the town. Things have gone\r\nagainst him. I dare say he couldn’t help it. I don’t accuse him of any\r\nharm,” said Mr. Vincy. He had always before been disposed to find the\r\nutmost fault with Lydgate.\r\n\r\nThe shock to Rosamond was terrible. It seemed to her that no lot could\r\nbe so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the\r\ncentre of infamous suspicions. In many cases it is inevitable that the\r\nshame is felt to be the worst part of crime; and it would have required\r\na great deal of disentangling reflection, such as had never entered\r\ninto Rosamond’s life, for her in these moments to feel that her trouble\r\nwas less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done\r\nsomething criminal. All the shame seemed to be there. And she had\r\ninnocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were\r\na glory to her! She showed her usual reticence to her parents, and only\r\nsaid, that if Lydgate had done as she wished he would have left\r\nMiddlemarch long ago.\r\n\r\n“She bears it beyond anything,” said her mother when she was gone.\r\n\r\n“Ah, thank God!” said Mr. Vincy, who was much broken down.\r\n\r\nBut Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her\r\nhusband. What had he really done—how had he really acted? She did not\r\nknow. Why had he not told her everything? He did not speak to her on\r\nthe subject, and of course she could not speak to him. It came into her\r\nmind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again; but\r\ndwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her: a\r\nmarried woman gone back to live with her parents—life seemed to have no\r\nmeaning for her in such a position: she could not contemplate herself\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThe next two days Lydgate observed a change in her, and believed that\r\nshe had heard the bad news. Would she speak to him about it, or would\r\nshe go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she\r\nbelieved him guilty? We must remember that he was in a morbid state of\r\nmind, in which almost all contact was pain. Certainly Rosamond in this\r\ncase had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on\r\nhis part; but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself;—was he\r\nnot justified in shrinking from the task of telling her, since now she\r\nknew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him? But a deeper-lying\r\nconsciousness that he was in fault made him restless, and the silence\r\nbetween them became intolerable to him; it was as if they were both\r\nadrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other.\r\n\r\nHe thought, “I am a fool. Haven’t I given up expecting anything? I have\r\nmarried care, not help.” And that evening he said—\r\n\r\n“Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying\r\non with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.\r\n\r\n“What have you heard?”\r\n\r\n“Everything, I suppose. Papa told me.”\r\n\r\n“That people think me disgraced?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rosamond, faintly, beginning to sew again automatically.\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Lydgate thought, “If she has any trust in me—any\r\nnotion of what I am, she ought to speak now and say that she does not\r\nbelieve I have deserved disgrace.”\r\n\r\nBut Rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly. Whatever\r\nwas to be said on the subject she expected to come from Tertius. What\r\ndid she know? And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do\r\nsomething to clear himself?\r\n\r\nThis silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in\r\nwhich Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in\r\nhim—even Farebrother had not come forward. He had begun to question her\r\nwith the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog\r\nwhich had gathered between them, but he felt his resolution checked by\r\ndespairing resentment. Even this trouble, like the rest, she seemed to\r\nregard as if it were hers alone. He was always to her a being apart,\r\ndoing what she objected to. He started from his chair with an angry\r\nimpulse, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked up and down the\r\nroom. There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he\r\nshould have to master this anger, and tell her everything, and convince\r\nher of the facts. For he had almost learned the lesson that he must\r\nbend himself to her nature, and that because she came short in her\r\nsympathy, he must give the more. Soon he recurred to his intention of\r\nopening himself: the occasion must not be lost. If he could bring her\r\nto feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met\r\nand not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come out of his\r\ndesperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully on\r\nher that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money\r\nas possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep\r\nthemselves independent. He would mention the definite measures which he\r\ndesired to take, and win her to a willing spirit. He was bound to try\r\nthis—and what else was there for him to do?\r\n\r\nHe did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and\r\nforwards, but Rosamond felt that it was long, and wished that he would\r\nsit down. She too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on\r\nTertius what he ought to do. Whatever might be the truth about all this\r\nmisery, there was one dread which asserted itself.\r\n\r\nLydgate at last seated himself, not in his usual chair, but in one\r\nnearer to Rosamond, leaning aside in it towards her, and looking at her\r\ngravely before he reopened the sad subject. He had conquered himself so\r\nfar, and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity, as on an\r\noccasion which was not to be repeated. He had even opened his lips,\r\nwhen Rosamond, letting her hands fall, looked at him and said—\r\n\r\n“Surely, Tertius—”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in\r\nMiddlemarch. I cannot go on living here. Let us go to London. Papa, and\r\nevery one else, says you had better go. Whatever misery I have to put\r\nup with, it will be easier away from here.”\r\n\r\nLydgate felt miserably jarred. Instead of that critical outpouring for\r\nwhich he had prepared himself with effort, here was the old round to be\r\ngone through again. He could not bear it. With a quick change of\r\ncountenance he rose and went out of the room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to\r\nbe the more because she was less, that evening might have had a better\r\nissue. If his energy could have borne down that check, he might still\r\nhave wrought on Rosamond’s vision and will. We cannot be sure that any\r\nnatures, however inflexible or peculiar, will resist this effect from a\r\nmore massive being than their own. They may be taken by storm and for\r\nthe moment converted, becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in\r\nthe ardor of its movement. But poor Lydgate had a throbbing pain within\r\nhim, and his energy had fallen short of its task.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as\r\never; nay, it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort.\r\nThey lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart, Lydgate\r\ngoing about what work he had in a mood of despair, and Rosamond\r\nfeeling, with some justification, that he was behaving cruelly. It was\r\nof no use to say anything to Tertius; but when Will Ladislaw came, she\r\nwas determined to tell him everything. In spite of her general\r\nreticence, she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nTo mercy, pity, peace, and love\r\n    All pray in their distress,\r\nAnd to these virtues of delight,\r\n    Return their thankfulness.\r\n. . . . . .\r\nFor Mercy has a human heart,\r\n    Pity a human face;\r\nAnd Love, the human form divine;\r\n    And Peace, the human dress.\r\n—WILLIAM BLAKE: _Songs of Innocence_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome days later, Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor, in consequence of\r\na summons from Dorothea. The summons had not been unexpected, since it\r\nhad followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in which he stated that he\r\nhad resumed his arrangements for quitting Middlemarch, and must remind\r\nLydgate of his previous communications about the Hospital, to the\r\npurport of which he still adhered. It had been his duty, before taking\r\nfurther steps, to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now\r\nwished, as before, to discuss the question with Lydgate. “Your views\r\nmay possibly have undergone some change,” wrote Mr. Bulstrode; “but, in\r\nthat case also, it is desirable that you should lay them before her.”\r\n\r\nDorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest. Though, in deference\r\nto her masculine advisers, she had refrained from what Sir James had\r\ncalled “interfering in this Bulstrode business,” the hardship of\r\nLydgate’s position was continually in her mind, and when Bulstrode\r\napplied to her again about the hospital, she felt that the opportunity\r\nwas come to her which she had been hindered from hastening. In her\r\nluxurious home, wandering under the boughs of her own great trees, her\r\nthought was going out over the lot of others, and her emotions were\r\nimprisoned. The idea of some active good within her reach, “haunted her\r\nlike a passion,” and another’s need having once come to her as a\r\ndistinct image, preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give\r\nrelief, and made her own ease tasteless. She was full of confident hope\r\nabout this interview with Lydgate, never heeding what was said of his\r\npersonal reserve; never heeding that she was a very young woman.\r\nNothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence\r\non her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship.\r\n\r\nAs she sat waiting in the library, she could do nothing but live\r\nthrough again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her\r\nmemories. They all owed their significance to her marriage and its\r\ntroubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate\r\nhad come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else. The\r\npain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her an awakened\r\nconjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be to him, a\r\nsusceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate. These thoughts\r\nwere like a drama to her, and made her eyes bright, and gave an\r\nattitude of suspense to her whole frame, though she was only looking\r\nout from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds\r\nwhich stood in relief against the dark evergreens.\r\n\r\nWhen Lydgate came in, she was almost shocked at the change in his face,\r\nwhich was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two\r\nmonths. It was not the change of emaciation, but that effect which even\r\nyoung faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of\r\nresentment and despondency. Her cordial look, when she put out her hand\r\nto him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.\r\n\r\n“I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr. Lydgate,”\r\nsaid Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other; “but I put off\r\nasking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me again about the\r\nHospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the management of it\r\nseparate from that of the Infirmary depends on you, or, at least, on\r\nthe good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your\r\ncontrol. And I am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“You want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the\r\nHospital,” said Lydgate. “I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it\r\nin dependence on any activity of mine. I may be obliged to leave the\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke curtly, feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to\r\ncarry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her mind against.\r\n\r\n“Not because there is no one to believe in you?” said Dorothea, pouring\r\nout her words in clearness from a full heart. “I know the unhappy\r\nmistakes about you. I knew them from the first moment to be mistakes.\r\nYou have never done anything vile. You would not do anything\r\ndishonorable.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on\r\nLydgate’s ears. He drew a deep breath, and said, “Thank you.” He could\r\nsay no more: it was something very new and strange in his life that\r\nthese few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him.\r\n\r\n“I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,\r\nfearlessly. “I am sure that the truth would clear you.”\r\n\r\nLydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window,\r\nforgetting where he was. He had so often gone over in his mind the\r\npossibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances\r\nthat would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and had so often\r\ndecided against it—he had so often said to himself that his assertions\r\nwould not change people’s impressions—that Dorothea’s words sounded\r\nlike a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had\r\npronounced to be unreasonable.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, pray,” said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; “then we can\r\nconsult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of any one\r\nfalsely, when it can be hindered.”\r\n\r\nLydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea’s face\r\nlooking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence of a\r\nnoble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes\r\nthe lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger,\r\nquieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in\r\nthe wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on\r\nLydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is\r\ndragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat down again, and felt\r\nthat he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was\r\nwith one who believed in it.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want,” he said, “to bear hard on Bulstrode, who has lent me\r\nmoney of which I was in need—though I would rather have gone without it\r\nnow. He is hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of\r\nlife in him. But I should like to tell you everything. It will be a\r\ncomfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand, and where I\r\nshall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty. You will\r\nfeel what is fair to another, as you feel what is fair to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do trust me,” said Dorothea; “I will not repeat anything without your\r\nleave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the\r\ncircumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way\r\nguilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James\r\nChettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go;\r\nalthough they don’t know much of me, they would believe me. They would\r\nknow that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would\r\ntake any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is nothing\r\nbetter that I can do in the world.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s voice, as she made this childlike picture of what she would\r\ndo, might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it\r\neffectively. The searching tenderness of her woman’s tones seemed made\r\nfor a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think\r\nthat she was Quixotic: he gave himself up, for the first time in his\r\nlife, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous\r\nsympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he told her\r\neverything, from the time when, under the pressure of his difficulties,\r\nhe unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode; gradually, in\r\nthe relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of what\r\nhad gone on in his mind—entering fully into the fact that his treatment\r\nof the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his doubts at\r\nthe last, his ideal of medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that\r\nthe acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private\r\ninclination and professional behavior, though not in his fulfilment of\r\nany publicly recognized obligation.\r\n\r\n“It has come to my knowledge since,” he added, “that Hawley sent some\r\none to examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she said that she\r\ngave the patient all the opium in the phial I left, as well as a good\r\ndeal of brandy. But that would not have been opposed to ordinary\r\nprescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions against me had no\r\nhold there: they are grounded on the knowledge that I took money, that\r\nBulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die, and that he\r\ngave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other\r\nagainst the patient—that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my\r\ntongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately,\r\nbecause they lie in people’s inclination and can never be disproved.\r\nHow my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know\r\nthe answer. It is still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any\r\ncriminal intention—even possible that he had nothing to do with the\r\ndisobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that has\r\nnothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases on which\r\na man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is believed that\r\nhe has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the\r\nmotive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me,\r\nbecause I took his money. I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of\r\ncorn—the business is done and can’t be undone.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty there is\r\nin your vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to you\r\nwho had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out\r\nbetter ways—I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know you\r\nmeant that. I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me\r\nabout the hospital. There is no sorrow I have thought more about than\r\nthat—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full\r\nmeaning of his grief. “I had some ambition. I meant everything to be\r\ndifferent with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the\r\nmost terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the\r\nHospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only\r\nwith the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you\r\nwould gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people\r\nwould be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you,\r\nbecause they would see that your purposes were pure. You may still win\r\na great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and\r\nwe shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate,\r\nmournfully. “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and\r\nrunning away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me.\r\nStill, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan\r\nwhich depends on me.”\r\n\r\n“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only think.\r\nI am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too\r\nlittle for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too\r\nmuch. I don’t know what to do. I have seven hundred a-year of my own\r\nfortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and\r\nbetween three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. I wished to\r\nraise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I don’t\r\nwant, to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of\r\nindustry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the risk\r\nwould be too great. So you see that what I should most rejoice at would\r\nbe to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make\r\nother people’s lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all\r\nto me who don’t want it.”\r\n\r\nA smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike\r\ngrave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was\r\nirresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding\r\nof high experience. (Of lower experience such as plays a great part in\r\nthe world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted\r\nknowledge, little helped by her imagination.) But she took the smile as\r\nencouragement of her plan.\r\n\r\n“I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a\r\ntone of persuasion. “The hospital would be one good; and making your\r\nlife quite whole and well again would be another.”\r\n\r\nLydgate’s smile had died away. “You have the goodness as well as the\r\nmoney to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. “But—”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and\r\nshe sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her and said\r\nimpetuously—\r\n\r\n“Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage is. You\r\nwill understand everything.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster. Had he that sorrow\r\ntoo? But she feared to say any word, and he went on immediately.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step without\r\nconsidering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might like to do if I\r\nwere alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see her miserable. She\r\nmarried me without knowing what she was going into, and it might have\r\nbeen better for her if she had not married me.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not obliged to\r\ndo it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own life.\r\n\r\n“And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The\r\ntroubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking off\r\nagain, lest he should say too much.\r\n\r\n“But when she saw the good that might come of staying—” said Dorothea,\r\nremonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons\r\nwhich had just been considered. He did not speak immediately.\r\n\r\n“She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at first that\r\nthis statement must do without explanation. “And, indeed, I have lost\r\nall spirit about carrying on my life here.” He paused a moment and\r\nthen, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the\r\ndifficulty of his life, he said, “The fact is, this trouble has come\r\nupon her confusedly. We have not been able to speak to each other about\r\nit. I am not sure what is in her mind about it: she may fear that I\r\nhave really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be more\r\nopen. But I have been suffering cruelly.”\r\n\r\n“May I go and see her?” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Would she accept my\r\nsympathy? I would tell her that you have not been blamable before any\r\none’s judgment but your own. I would tell her that you shall be cleared\r\nin every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may\r\ngo to see her? I did see her once.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some\r\nhope. “She would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof that you\r\nat least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her about your\r\ncoming—that she may not connect it with my wishes at all. I know very\r\nwell that I ought not to have left anything to be told her by others,\r\nbut—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and there was a moment’s silence. Dorothea refrained from\r\nsaying what was in her mind—how well she knew that there might be\r\ninvisible barriers to speech between husband and wife. This was a point\r\non which even sympathy might make a wound. She returned to the more\r\noutward aspect of Lydgate’s position, saying cheerfully—\r\n\r\n“And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in\r\nyou and support you, she might then be glad that you should stay in\r\nyour place and recover your hopes—and do what you meant to do. Perhaps\r\nthen you would see that it was right to agree with what I proposed\r\nabout your continuing at the Hospital. Surely you would, if you still\r\nhave faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful?”\r\n\r\nLydgate did not answer, and she saw that he was debating with himself.\r\n\r\n“You need not decide immediately,” she said, gently. “A few days hence\r\nit will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr. Bulstrode.”\r\n\r\nLydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his most decisive\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“No; I prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering. I am\r\nno longer sure enough of myself—I mean of what it would be possible for\r\nme to do under the changed circumstances of my life. It would be\r\ndishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in\r\ndependence on me. I might be obliged to go away after all; I see little\r\nchance of anything else. The whole thing is too problematic; I cannot\r\nconsent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted. No—let the new\r\nHospital be joined with the old Infirmary, and everything go on as it\r\nmight have done if I had never come. I have kept a valuable register\r\nsince I have been there; I shall send it to a man who will make use of\r\nit,” he ended bitterly. “I can think of nothing for a long while but\r\ngetting an income.”\r\n\r\n“It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,” said Dorothea.\r\n“It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in your future,\r\nin your power to do great things, if you would let them save you from\r\nthat. Think how much money I have; it would be like taking a burthen\r\nfrom me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this\r\nfettering want of income. Why should not people do these things? It is\r\nso difficult to make shares at all even. This is one way.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!” said Lydgate, rising as if with the\r\nsame impulse that made his words energetic, and resting his arm on the\r\nback of the great leather chair he had been sitting in. “It is good\r\nthat you should have such feelings. But I am not the man who ought to\r\nallow himself to benefit by them. I have not given guarantees enough. I\r\nmust not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work\r\nthat I never achieved. It is very clear to me that I must not count on\r\nanything else than getting away from Middlemarch as soon as I can\r\nmanage it. I should not be able for a long while, at the very best, to\r\nget an income here, and—and it is easier to make necessary changes in a\r\nnew place. I must do as other men do, and think what will please the\r\nworld and bring in money; look for a little opening in the London\r\ncrowd, and push myself; set up in a watering-place, or go to some\r\nsouthern town where there are plenty of idle English, and get myself\r\npuffed,—that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my\r\nsoul alive in.”\r\n\r\n“Now that is not brave,” said Dorothea,—“to give up the fight.”\r\n\r\n“No, it is not brave,” said Lydgate, “but if a man is afraid of\r\ncreeping paralysis?” Then, in another tone, “Yet you have made a great\r\ndifference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more\r\nbearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few\r\nother minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be deeply grateful.\r\nThe point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my\r\norders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence\r\nfor me but people’s opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my\r\nown report of myself.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said Dorothea. “I\r\ncan say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be\r\nbribed to do a wickedness.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his voice.\r\n“I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery\r\nwhich is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great\r\nkindness, then, and come to see my wife?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into whose\r\nmind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope she will\r\nlike me.”\r\n\r\nAs Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart\r\nlarge enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks nothing of her\r\nown future, and would pledge away half her income at once, as if she\r\nwanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can\r\nlook down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her.\r\nShe seems to have what I never saw in any woman before—a fountain of\r\nfriendship towards men—a man can make a friend of her. Casaubon must\r\nhave raised some heroic hallucination in her. I wonder if she could\r\nhave any other sort of passion for a man? Ladislaw?—there was certainly\r\nan unusual feeling between them. And Casaubon must have had a notion of\r\nit. Well—her love might help a man more than her money.”\r\n\r\nDorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate\r\nfrom his obligation to Bulstrode, which she felt sure was a part,\r\nthough small, of the galling pressure he had to bear. She sat down at\r\nonce under the inspiration of their interview, and wrote a brief note,\r\nin which she pleaded that she had more claim than Mr. Bulstrode had to\r\nthe satisfaction of providing the money which had been serviceable to\r\nLydgate—that it would be unkind in Lydgate not to grant her the\r\nposition of being his helper in this small matter, the favor being\r\nentirely to her who had so little that was plainly marked out for her\r\nto do with her superfluous money. He might call her a creditor or by\r\nany other name if it did but imply that he granted her request. She\r\nenclosed a check for a thousand pounds, and determined to take the\r\nletter with her the next day when she went to see Rosamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\n“And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,\r\nTo mark the full-fraught man and best indued\r\nWith some suspicion.”\r\n—_Henry V_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that he\r\nshould be away until the evening. Of late she had never gone beyond her\r\nown house and garden, except to church, and once to see her papa, to\r\nwhom she said, “If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will\r\nyou not, papa? I suppose we shall have very little money. I am sure I\r\nhope some one will help us.” And Mr. Vincy had said, “Yes, child, I\r\ndon’t mind a hundred or two. I can see the end of that.” With these\r\nexceptions she had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense,\r\nfixing her mind on Will Ladislaw’s coming as the one point of hope and\r\ninterest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make\r\nimmediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London,\r\ntill she felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the\r\ngoing, without at all seeing how. This way of establishing sequences is\r\ntoo common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond. And\r\nit is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock\r\nwhen it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is often\r\nto see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except the\r\ndesirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of\r\ndoubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive. That was the process\r\ngoing on in poor Rosamond, while she arranged all objects around her\r\nwith the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness—or sat down to\r\nthe piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the\r\nmusic stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and\r\nlooking before her in dreamy ennui. Her melancholy had become so marked\r\nthat Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it, as a perpetual silent\r\nreproach, and the strong man, mastered by his keen sensibilities\r\ntowards this fair fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have\r\nbruised, shrank from her look, and sometimes started at her approach,\r\nfear of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it\r\nhad been momentarily expelled by exasperation.\r\n\r\nBut this morning Rosamond descended from her room upstairs—where she\r\nsometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out—equipped for a walk in\r\nthe town. She had a letter to post—a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw\r\nand written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten his\r\narrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their sole\r\nhouse-servant now, noticed her coming down-stairs in her walking dress,\r\nand thought “there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dorothea’s mind was filled with her project of going to\r\nRosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable\r\nfuture, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until yesterday\r\nwhen Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married\r\nlife, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with\r\nthat of Will Ladislaw. Even in her most uneasy moments—even when she\r\nhad been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of\r\ngossip—her effort, nay, her strongest impulsive prompting, had been\r\ntowards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when,\r\nin her meeting with him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his\r\nwords as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he\r\nwas determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick,\r\nsad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant\r\nopportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely\r\nshared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music. But\r\nthere had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which\r\nhe had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held\r\nhim in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved\r\nnot to declare but to carry away into banishment. From the time of that\r\nparting, Dorothea, believing in Will’s love for her, believing with a\r\nproud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that\r\nno one should impeach him justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to\r\nthe regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate. She was sure that the regard\r\nwas blameless.\r\n\r\nThere are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having\r\na sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and\r\npurity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst\r\nkind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust. “If\r\nyou are not good, none is good”—those little words may give a terrific\r\nmeaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse.\r\n\r\nDorothea’s nature was of that kind: her own passionate faults lay along\r\nthe easily counted open channels of her ardent character; and while she\r\nwas full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, she had not yet\r\nany material within her experience for subtle constructions and\r\nsuspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity of hers, holding up an\r\nideal for others in her believing conception of them, was one of the\r\ngreat powers of her womanhood. And it had from the first acted strongly\r\non Will Ladislaw. He felt, when he parted from her, that the brief\r\nwords by which he had tried to convey to her his feeling about herself\r\nand the division which her fortune made between them, would only profit\r\nby their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them: he felt that in\r\nher mind he had found his highest estimate.\r\n\r\nAnd he was right there. In the months since their parting Dorothea had\r\nfelt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as\r\none which was inwardly whole and without blemish. She had an active\r\nforce of antagonism within her, when the antagonism turned on the\r\ndefence either of plans or persons that she believed in; and the wrongs\r\nwhich she felt that Will had received from her husband, and the\r\nexternal conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him,\r\nonly gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment. And\r\nnow with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact\r\naffecting Will’s social position, which roused afresh Dorothea’s inward\r\nresistance to what was said about him in that part of her world which\r\nlay within park palings.\r\n\r\n“Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a phrase\r\nwhich had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode\r\nbusiness, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of\r\nplacard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with white mice.” Upright\r\nSir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous\r\nwhen he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to\r\nthat mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled\r\nhim to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd. And perhaps\r\nthere had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this\r\nugly bit of Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his\r\nown folly by. Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part\r\nin the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had\r\nuttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in\r\nspeaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between\r\nthem which must always remain in consecrated secrecy. But her silence\r\nshrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this\r\nmisfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling\r\nat his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to\r\nher clinging thought.\r\n\r\nShe entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and\r\nyet she had taken no posture of renunciation. She had accepted her\r\nwhole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and\r\nwould have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail\r\nbecause she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on\r\nthe superfluities of her lot. She could bear that the chief pleasures\r\nof her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came\r\nto her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she\r\nat present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends,\r\nwould be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your\r\nproperty for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of\r\nsuitable characteristics. “I should like to manage it myself, if I knew\r\nwhat to do with it,” said Dorothea. No—she adhered to her declaration\r\nthat she would never be married again, and in the long valley of her\r\nlife which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as\r\nshe walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by the way.\r\n\r\nThis habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in\r\nall her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs.\r\nLydgate, making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond’s\r\nfigure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and\r\ncompassion. There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to\r\ncomplete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband\r\nwho had yet made her happiness a law to him. That was a trouble which\r\nno third person must directly touch. But Dorothea thought with deep\r\npity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the\r\nsuspicions cast on her husband; and there would surely be help in the\r\nmanifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her.\r\n\r\n“I shall talk to her about her husband,” thought Dorothea, as she was\r\nbeing driven towards the town. The clear spring morning, the scent of\r\nthe moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth\r\nof greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the\r\ncheerfulness she was feeling from a long conversation with Mr.\r\nFarebrother, who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of\r\nLydgate’s conduct. “I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps\r\nshe will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.”\r\n\r\nDorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new\r\nfine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of her\r\ncarriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the street,\r\nhaving told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door was\r\nopen, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the\r\ncarriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to her\r\nthat the lady who “belonged to it” was coming towards her.\r\n\r\n“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure, my lady; I’ll see, if you’ll please to walk in,” said\r\nMartha, a little confused on the score of her kitchen apron, but\r\ncollected enough to be sure that “mum” was not the right title for this\r\nqueenly young widow with a carriage and pair. “Will you please to walk\r\nin, and I’ll go and see.”\r\n\r\n“Say that I am Mrs. Casaubon,” said Dorothea, as Martha moved forward\r\nintending to show her into the drawing-room and then to go up-stairs to\r\nsee if Rosamond had returned from her walk.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned up the\r\npassage which led to the garden. The drawing-room door was unlatched,\r\nand Martha, pushing it without looking into the room, waited for Mrs.\r\nCasaubon to enter and then turned away, the door having swung open and\r\nswung back again without noise.\r\n\r\nDorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being\r\nfilled with images of things as they had been and were going to be. She\r\nfound herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything\r\nremarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones\r\nwhich startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and\r\nadvancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a\r\nbookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which\r\nfilled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless,\r\nwithout self-possession enough to speak.\r\n\r\nSeated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall\r\non a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw Will\r\nLadislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed\r\ntearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond, her\r\nbonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped both her\r\nupraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.\r\n\r\nRosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently\r\nadvancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable\r\ninstant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself\r\nimpeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her\r\npresence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and\r\nrose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will Ladislaw,\r\nstarting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s eyes with a new\r\nlightning in them, seemed changing to marble. But she immediately\r\nturned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a firm voice—\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.\r\nI called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished\r\nto put into your own hands.”\r\n\r\nShe laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her\r\nretreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and\r\nbow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the\r\nsurprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home,\r\nand then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that\r\ngrand people were probably more impatient than others.\r\n\r\nDorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was\r\nquickly in her carriage again.\r\n\r\n“Drive on to Freshitt Hall,” she said to the coachman, and any one\r\nlooking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual\r\nshe was never animated by a more self-possessed energy. And that was\r\nreally her experience. It was as if she had drunk a great draught of\r\nscorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.\r\nShe had seen something so far below her belief, that her emotions\r\nrushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She\r\nneeded something active to turn her excitement out upon. She felt power\r\nto walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she would carry\r\nout the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to\r\nFreshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished\r\nthem to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial\r\nnow presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more\r\nardent in readiness to be his champion. She had never felt anything\r\nlike this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her\r\nmarried life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang;\r\nand she took it as a sign of new strength.\r\n\r\n“Dodo, how very bright your eyes are!” said Celia, when Sir James was\r\ngone out of the room. “And you don’t see anything you look at, Arthur\r\nor anything. You are going to do something uncomfortable, I know. Is it\r\nall about Mr. Lydgate, or has something else happened?” Celia had been\r\nused to watch her sister with expectation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, a great many things have happened,” said Dodo, in her full\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what,” said Celia, folding her arms cozily and leaning\r\nforward upon them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth,” said\r\nDorothea, lifting her arms to the back of her head.\r\n\r\n“Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?” said Celia, a\r\nlittle uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange,\r\nand she finished her expedition well, not swerving in her resolution\r\nuntil she descended at her own door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n“Would it were yesterday and I i’ the grave,\r\nWith her sweet faith above for monument.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRosamond and Will stood motionless—they did not know how long—he\r\nlooking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood, and she looking\r\ntowards him with doubt. It seemed an endless time to Rosamond, in whose\r\ninmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification from\r\nwhat had just happened. Shallow natures dream of an easy sway over the\r\nemotions of others, trusting implicitly in their own petty magic to\r\nturn the deepest streams, and confident, by pretty gestures and\r\nremarks, of making the thing that is not as though it were. She knew\r\nthat Will had received a severe blow, but she had been little used to\r\nimagining other people’s states of mind except as a material cut into\r\nshape by her own wishes; and she believed in her own power to soothe or\r\nsubdue. Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always subdued in\r\nthe long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond would have\r\nsaid now, as she did before her marriage, that she never gave up what\r\nshe had set her mind on.\r\n\r\nShe put out her arm and laid the tips of her fingers on Will’s\r\ncoat-sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch me!” he said, with an utterance like the cut of a lash,\r\ndarting from her, and changing from pink to white and back again, as if\r\nhis whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting. He wheeled\r\nround to the other side of the room and stood opposite to her, with the\r\ntips of his fingers in his pockets and his head thrown back, looking\r\nfiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from her.\r\n\r\nShe was keenly offended, but the signs she made of this were such as\r\nonly Lydgate was used to interpret. She became suddenly quiet and\r\nseated herself, untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her\r\nshawl. Her little hands which she folded before her were very cold.\r\n\r\nIt would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken\r\nup his hat and gone away; but he had felt no impulse to do this; on the\r\ncontrary, he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond\r\nwith his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had\r\ndrawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther\r\nto bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet—how\r\ncould he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her? He was fuming\r\nunder a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge: he was\r\ndangerously poised, and Rosamond’s voice now brought the decisive\r\nvibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she said—\r\n\r\n“You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference.”\r\n\r\n“Go after her!” he burst out, with a sharp edge in his voice. “Do you\r\nthink she would turn to look at me, or value any word I ever uttered to\r\nher again at more than a dirty feather?—Explain! How can a man explain\r\nat the expense of a woman?”\r\n\r\n“You can tell her what you please,” said Rosamond with more tremor.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you? She is\r\nnot a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable—to believe\r\nthat I must be true to her because I was a dastard to you.”\r\n\r\nHe began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees\r\nprey but cannot reach it. Presently he burst out again—\r\n\r\n“I had no hope before—not much—of anything better to come. But I had\r\none certainty—that she believed in me. Whatever people had said or done\r\nabout me, she believed in me.—That’s gone! She’ll never again think me\r\nanything but a paltry pretence—too nice to take heaven except upon\r\nflattering conditions, and yet selling myself for any devil’s change by\r\nthe sly. She’ll think of me as an incarnate insult to her, from the\r\nfirst moment we—”\r\n\r\nWill stopped as if he had found himself grasping something that must\r\nnot be thrown and shattered. He found another vent for his rage by\r\nsnatching up Rosamond’s words again, as if they were reptiles to be\r\nthrottled and flung off.\r\n\r\n“Explain! Tell a man to explain how he dropped into hell! Explain my\r\npreference! I never had a _preference_ for her, any more than I have a\r\npreference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her. I\r\nwould rather touch her hand if it were dead, than I would touch any\r\nother woman’s living.”\r\n\r\nRosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her, was\r\nalmost losing the sense of her identity, and seemed to be waking into\r\nsome new terrible existence. She had no sense of chill resolute\r\nrepulsion, of reticent self-justification such as she had known under\r\nLydgate’s most stormy displeasure: all her sensibility was turned into\r\na bewildering novelty of pain; she felt a new terrified recoil under a\r\nlash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition\r\nto her own was being burnt and bitten into her consciousness. When Will\r\nhad ceased to speak she had become an image of sickened misery: her\r\nlips were pale, and her eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it had\r\nbeen Tertius who stood opposite to her, that look of misery would have\r\nbeen a pang to him, and he would have sunk by her side to comfort her,\r\nwith that strong-armed comfort which she had often held very cheap.\r\n\r\nLet it be forgiven to Will that he had no such movement of pity. He had\r\nfelt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal\r\ntreasure of his life, and he held himself blameless. He knew that he\r\nwas cruel, but he had no relenting in him yet.\r\n\r\nAfter he had done speaking, he still moved about, half in absence of\r\nmind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to\r\nbethink himself, took up his hat, yet stood some moments irresolute. He\r\nhad spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness\r\ndifficult to utter; and yet, now that he had come to the point of going\r\naway from her without further speech, he shrank from it as a brutality;\r\nhe felt checked and stultified in his anger. He walked towards the\r\nmantel-piece and leaned his arm on it, and waited in silence for—he\r\nhardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in him, and he\r\ncould utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in his\r\nmind that having come back to this hearth where he had enjoyed a\r\ncaressing friendship he had found calamity seated there—he had had\r\nsuddenly revealed to him a trouble that lay outside the home as well as\r\nwithin it. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with\r\nslow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless\r\nwoman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her\r\nheart. But he was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his quick\r\napprehensiveness foreshadowed to him, and when his eyes fell on\r\nRosamond’s blighted face it seemed to him that he was the more pitiable\r\nof the two; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory\r\nbefore it can turn into compassion.\r\n\r\nAnd so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart,\r\nin silence; Will’s face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond’s\r\nby a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion\r\nin return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her\r\nhope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken\r\nher: her little world was in ruins, and she felt herself tottering in\r\nthe midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness.\r\n\r\nWill wished that she would speak and bring some mitigating shadow\r\nacross his own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both\r\nin mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But she said nothing,\r\nand at last with a desperate effort over himself, he asked, “Shall I\r\ncome in and see Lydgate this evening?”\r\n\r\n“If you like,” Rosamond answered, just audibly.\r\n\r\nAnd then Will went out of the house, Martha never knowing that he had\r\nbeen in.\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone, Rosamond tried to get up from her seat, but fell\r\nback fainting. When she came to herself again, she felt too ill to make\r\nthe exertion of rising to ring the bell, and she remained helpless\r\nuntil the girl, surprised at her long absence, thought for the first\r\ntime of looking for her in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said\r\nthat she had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped\r\nup-stairs. When there she threw herself on the bed with her clothes on,\r\nand lay in apparent torpor, as she had done once before on a memorable\r\nday of grief.\r\n\r\nLydgate came home earlier than he had expected, about half-past five,\r\nand found her there. The perception that she was ill threw every other\r\nthought into the background. When he felt her pulse, her eyes rested on\r\nhim with more persistence than they had done for a long while, as if\r\nshe felt some content that he was there. He perceived the difference in\r\na moment, and seating himself by her put his arm gently under her, and\r\nbending over her said, “My poor Rosamond! has something agitated you?”\r\nClinging to him she fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and for\r\nthe next hour he did nothing but soothe and tend her. He imagined that\r\nDorothea had been to see her, and that all this effect on her nervous\r\nsystem, which evidently involved some new turning towards himself, was\r\ndue to the excitement of the new impressions which that visit had\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n“Now, I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended their talk, they\r\ndrew nigh to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of the plain;\r\nand they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name\r\nof the slough was Despond.”—BUNYAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Rosamond was quiet, and Lydgate had left her, hoping that she\r\nmight soon sleep under the effect of an anodyne, he went into the\r\ndrawing-room to fetch a book which he had left there, meaning to spend\r\nthe evening in his work-room, and he saw on the table Dorothea’s letter\r\naddressed to him. He had not ventured to ask Rosamond if Mrs. Casaubon\r\nhad called, but the reading of this letter assured him of the fact, for\r\nDorothea mentioned that it was to be carried by herself.\r\n\r\nWhen Will Ladislaw came in a little later Lydgate met him with a\r\nsurprise which made it clear that he had not been told of the earlier\r\nvisit, and Will could not say, “Did not Mrs. Lydgate tell you that I\r\ncame this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Poor Rosamond is ill,” Lydgate added immediately on his greeting.\r\n\r\n“Not seriously, I hope,” said Will.\r\n\r\n“No—only a slight nervous shock—the effect of some agitation. She has\r\nbeen overwrought lately. The truth is, Ladislaw, I am an unlucky devil.\r\nWe have gone through several rounds of purgatory since you left, and I\r\nhave lately got on to a worse ledge of it than ever. I suppose you are\r\nonly just come down—you look rather battered—you have not been long\r\nenough in the town to hear anything?”\r\n\r\n“I travelled all night and got to the White Hart at eight o’clock this\r\nmorning. I have been shutting myself up and resting,” said Will,\r\nfeeling himself a sneak, but seeing no alternative to this evasion.\r\n\r\nAnd then he heard Lydgate’s account of the troubles which Rosamond had\r\nalready depicted to him in her way. She had not mentioned the fact of\r\nWill’s name being connected with the public story—this detail not\r\nimmediately affecting her—and he now heard it for the first time.\r\n\r\n“I thought it better to tell you that your name is mixed up with the\r\ndisclosures,” said Lydgate, who could understand better than most men\r\nhow Ladislaw might be stung by the revelation. “You will be sure to\r\nhear it as soon as you turn out into the town. I suppose it is true\r\nthat Raffles spoke to you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Will, sardonically. “I shall be fortunate if gossip does\r\nnot make me the most disreputable person in the whole affair. I should\r\nthink the latest version must be, that I plotted with Raffles to murder\r\nBulstrode, and ran away from Middlemarch for the purpose.”\r\n\r\nHe was thinking “Here is a new ring in the sound of my name to\r\nrecommend it in her hearing; however—what does it signify now?”\r\n\r\nBut he said nothing of Bulstrode’s offer to him. Will was very open and\r\ncareless about his personal affairs, but it was among the more\r\nexquisite touches in nature’s modelling of him that he had a delicate\r\ngenerosity which warned him into reticence here. He shrank from saying\r\nthat he had rejected Bulstrode’s money, in the moment when he was\r\nlearning that it was Lydgate’s misfortune to have accepted it.\r\n\r\nLydgate too was reticent in the midst of his confidence. He made no\r\nallusion to Rosamond’s feeling under their trouble, and of Dorothea he\r\nonly said, “Mrs. Casaubon has been the one person to come forward and\r\nsay that she had no belief in any of the suspicions against me.”\r\nObserving a change in Will’s face, he avoided any further mention of\r\nher, feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not\r\nto fear that his words might have some hidden painful bearing on it.\r\nAnd it occurred to him that Dorothea was the real cause of the present\r\nvisit to Middlemarch.\r\n\r\nThe two men were pitying each other, but it was only Will who guessed\r\nthe extent of his companion’s trouble. When Lydgate spoke with\r\ndesperate resignation of going to settle in London, and said with a\r\nfaint smile, “We shall have you again, old fellow,” Will felt\r\ninexpressibly mournful, and said nothing. Rosamond had that morning\r\nentreated him to urge this step on Lydgate; and it seemed to him as if\r\nhe were beholding in a magic panorama a future where he himself was\r\nsliding into that pleasureless yielding to the small solicitations of\r\ncircumstance, which is a commoner history of perdition than any single\r\nmomentous bargain.\r\n\r\nWe are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our\r\nfuture selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into\r\ninsipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was inwardly\r\ngroaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it. It seemed to him\r\nthis evening as if the cruelty of his outburst to Rosamond had made an\r\nobligation for him, and he dreaded the obligation: he dreaded Lydgate’s\r\nunsuspecting good-will: he dreaded his own distaste for his spoiled\r\nlife, which would leave him in motiveless levity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nStern lawgiver! yet thou dost wear\r\nThe Godhead’s most benignant grace;\r\nNor know we anything so fair\r\nAs is the smile upon thy face;\r\nFlowers laugh before thee on their beds,\r\nAnd fragrance in thy footing treads;\r\nThou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;\r\nAnd the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.\r\n—WORDSWORTH: _Ode to Duty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she had promised\r\nto go and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt. There was\r\na frequent interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother\r\nfamily, which enabled her to say that she was not at all lonely at the\r\nManor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady\r\ncompanion. When she reached home and remembered her engagement, she was\r\nglad of it; and finding that she had still an hour before she could\r\ndress for dinner, she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered\r\ninto a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell,\r\ngiving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and\r\ngetting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy. She paused on\r\nher way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some\r\ngarden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the\r\ncrops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the\r\nresult of sixty years’ experience as to soils—namely, that if your soil\r\nwas pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make\r\nit all of a mummy, why then—\r\n\r\nFinding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being rather late,\r\nshe dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than\r\nwas necessary. That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like another\r\nWhite of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of his\r\ninarticulate guests and _proteges_, whom he was teaching the boys not\r\nto torment; and he had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets\r\nof the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals. The\r\nevening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than\r\nusual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of\r\ncreatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for\r\naught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some\r\ninarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody’s\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“Henrietta Noble,” said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her small sister\r\nmoving about the furniture-legs distressfully, “what is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box. I fear the kitten has\r\nrolled it away,” said the tiny old lady, involuntarily continuing her\r\nbeaver-like notes.\r\n\r\n“Is it a great treasure, aunt?” said Mr. Farebrother, putting up his\r\nglasses and looking at the carpet.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ladislaw gave it me,” said Miss Noble. “A German box—very pretty,\r\nbut if it falls it always spins away as far as it can.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if it is Ladislaw’s present,” said Mr. Farebrother, in a deep tone\r\nof comprehension, getting up and hunting. The box was found at last\r\nunder a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with delight, saying, “it\r\nwas under a fender the last time.”\r\n\r\n“That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,” said Mr. Farebrother,\r\nsmiling at Dorothea, as he reseated himself.\r\n\r\n“If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon,”\r\nsaid his mother, emphatically,—“she is like a dog—she would take their\r\nshoes for a pillow and sleep the better.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ladislaw’s shoes, I would,” said Henrietta Noble.\r\n\r\nDorothea made an attempt at smiling in return. She was surprised and\r\nannoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and that it\r\nwas quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation.\r\nAlarmed at herself—fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked\r\nin its occasion, she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised\r\nanxiety, “I must go; I have overtired myself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, “It is true; you\r\nmust have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate. That sort\r\nof work tells upon one after the excitement is over.”\r\n\r\nHe gave her his arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to\r\nspeak, even when he said good-night.\r\n\r\nThe limit of resistance was reached, and she had sunk back helpless\r\nwithin the clutch of inescapable anguish. Dismissing Tantripp with a\r\nfew faint words, she locked her door, and turning away from it towards\r\nthe vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head, and\r\nmoaned out—\r\n\r\n“Oh, I did love him!”\r\n\r\nThen came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too\r\nthoroughly to leave any power of thought. She could only cry in loud\r\nwhispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she had planted\r\nand kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome—after her\r\nlost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized\r\nby others, was worthy in her thought—after her lost woman’s pride of\r\nreigning in his memory—after her sweet dim perspective of hope, that\r\nalong some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take\r\nup the backward years as a yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have\r\nlooked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man—she besought\r\nhardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the\r\nmysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she lay on the bare floor\r\nand let the night grow cold around her; while her grand woman’s frame\r\nwas shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child.\r\n\r\nThere were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in two, as\r\nif it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided\r\nby the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her\r\ngaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the\r\nlying woman that has never known the mother’s pang.\r\n\r\nHere, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the\r\nvibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she had\r\ntrusted—who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim\r\nvault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a\r\nfull consciousness which had never awakened before, she stretched out\r\nher arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness\r\nwas a parting vision: she discovered her passion to herself in the\r\nunshrinking utterance of despair.\r\n\r\nAnd there, aloof, yet persistently with her, moving wherever she moved,\r\nwas the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a\r\ndetected illusion—no, a living man towards whom there could not yet\r\nstruggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and\r\nindignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of Dorothea’s anger\r\nwas not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning\r\nreproach. Why had he come obtruding his life into hers, hers that might\r\nhave been whole enough without him? Why had he brought his cheap regard\r\nand his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in\r\nexchange? He knew that he was deluding her—wished, in the very moment\r\nof farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of\r\nher heart, and knew that he had spent it half before. Why had he not\r\nstayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing—but only prayed that\r\nthey might be less contemptible?\r\n\r\nBut she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and\r\nmoans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she\r\nsobbed herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around\r\nher, she awoke—not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had\r\nhappened, but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into\r\nthe eyes of sorrow. She rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and\r\nseated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before. She\r\nwas vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill\r\nin body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she had waked to a new\r\ncondition: she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible\r\nconflict; she was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit\r\ndown with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her\r\nthoughts. For now the thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea’s\r\nnature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the\r\nnarrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness\r\nthat only sees another’s lot as an accident of its own.\r\n\r\nShe began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately\r\nagain, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible\r\nmeaning. Was she alone in that scene? Was it her event only? She forced\r\nherself to think of it as bound up with another woman’s life—a woman\r\ntowards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and\r\ncomfort into her beclouded youth. In her first outleap of jealous\r\nindignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she had flung\r\naway all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit. She had\r\nenveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to\r\nher as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever. But that base\r\nprompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless\r\nlover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the\r\ndominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and\r\nhad once shown her the truer measure of things. All the active thought\r\nwith which she had before been representing to herself the trials of\r\nLydgate’s lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own,\r\nseemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid\r\nsympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted\r\nitself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as\r\nwe saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own irremediable\r\ngrief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her\r\nback from effort.\r\n\r\nAnd what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact\r\nwith hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants\r\nbearing the sacred branch? The objects of her rescue were not to be\r\nsought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her. She yearned towards\r\nthe perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her, and rule her\r\nerrant will. “What should I do—how should I act now, this very day, if\r\nI could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of\r\nthose three?”\r\n\r\nIt had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light\r\npiercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards\r\nthe bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the\r\nentrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back\r\nand a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures\r\nmoving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky\r\nwas the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the\r\nmanifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a part of that\r\ninvoluntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from\r\nher luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish\r\ncomplaining.\r\n\r\nWhat she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but\r\nsomething that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching\r\nmurmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes\r\nwhich seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them,\r\nand began to make her toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came\r\nin her dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n“Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst out\r\nTantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face, which\r\nin spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater\r\ndolorosa. “You’ll kill yourself, you _will_. Anybody might think now\r\nyou had a right to give yourself a little comfort.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have slept; I\r\nam not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible. And\r\nI want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my\r\nnew bonnet to-day.”\r\n\r\n“They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most\r\nthankful I shall be to see you with a couple o’ pounds’ worth less of\r\ncrape,” said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s a reason in\r\nmourning, as I’ve always said; and three folds at the bottom of your\r\nskirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet—and if ever anybody looked\r\nlike an angel, it’s you in a net quilling—is what’s consistent for a\r\nsecond year. At least, that’s _my_ thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking\r\nanxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was to marry me flattering\r\nhimself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he’d be\r\ndeceived by his own vanity, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she used to\r\ndo in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; “get me the\r\ncoffee.”\r\n\r\nShe folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head against it\r\nin fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this\r\nstrange contrariness in her young mistress—that just the morning when\r\nshe had more of a widow’s face than ever, she should have asked for her\r\nlighter mourning which she had waived before. Tantripp would never have\r\nfound the clew to this mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she\r\nhad not the less an active life before her because she had buried a\r\nprivate joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all\r\ninitiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp after even that slight\r\noutward help towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless at eleven o’clock she was walking towards Middlemarch,\r\nhaving made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably\r\nas possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nDu Erde warst auch diese Nacht beständig,\r\nUnd athmest neu erquickt zu meinen Füssen,\r\nBeginnest schon mit Lust mich zu umgeben,\r\nDu regst und rührst ein kräftiges Beschliessen\r\n_Zum höchsten Dasein immerfort zu streben_.\r\n—_Faust:_ 2r Theil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea was again at Lydgate’s door speaking to Martha, he was in\r\nthe room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. He heard her\r\nvoice, and immediately came to her.\r\n\r\n“Do you think that Mrs. Lydgate can receive me this morning?” she said,\r\nhaving reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to\r\nher previous visit.\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt she will,” said Lydgate, suppressing his thought about\r\nDorothea’s looks, which were as much changed as Rosamond’s, “if you\r\nwill be kind enough to come in and let me tell her that you are here.\r\nShe has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but she is\r\nbetter this morning, and I think it is very likely that she will be\r\ncheered by seeing you again.”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about\r\nthe circumstances of her yesterday’s visit; nay, he appeared to imagine\r\nthat she had carried it out according to her intention. She had\r\nprepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have\r\ngiven to the servant if he had not been in the way, but now she was in\r\nmuch anxiety as to the result of his announcement.\r\n\r\nAfter leading her into the drawing-room, he paused to take a letter\r\nfrom his pocket and put it into her hands, saying, “I wrote this last\r\nnight, and was going to carry it to Lowick in my ride. When one is\r\ngrateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less\r\nunsatisfactory than speech—one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate\r\nthe words are.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s face brightened. “It is I who have most to thank for, since\r\nyou have let me take that place. You _have_ consented?” she said,\r\nsuddenly doubting.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the check is going to Bulstrode to-day.”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately\r\nfinished dressing herself, and sat languidly wondering what she should\r\ndo next, her habitual industry in small things, even in the days of her\r\nsadness, prompting her to begin some kind of occupation, which she\r\ndragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest. She looked\r\nill, but had recovered her usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had\r\nfeared to disturb her by any questions. He had told her of Dorothea’s\r\nletter containing the check, and afterwards he had said, “Ladislaw is\r\ncome, Rosy; he sat with me last night; I dare say he will be here again\r\nto-day. I thought he looked rather battered and depressed.” And\r\nRosamond had made no reply.\r\n\r\nNow, when he came up, he said to her very gently, “Rosy, dear, Mrs.\r\nCasaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see her, would you\r\nnot?” That she colored and gave rather a startled movement did not\r\nsurprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday—a\r\nbeneficent agitation, he thought, since it seemed to have made her turn\r\nto him again.\r\n\r\nRosamond dared not say no. She dared not with a tone of her voice touch\r\nthe facts of yesterday. Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again? The answer\r\nwas a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread, for Will\r\nLadislaw’s lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a fresh\r\nsmart to her. Nevertheless, in her new humiliating uncertainty she\r\ndared do nothing but comply. She did not say yes, but she rose and let\r\nLydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders, while he said, “I am\r\ngoing out immediately.” Then something crossed her mind which prompted\r\nher to say, “Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the\r\ndrawing-room.” And Lydgate assented, thinking that he fully understood\r\nthis wish. He led her down to the drawing-room door, and then turned\r\naway, observing to himself that he was rather a blundering husband to\r\nbe dependent for his wife’s trust in him on the influence of another\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nRosamond, wrapping her soft shawl around her as she walked towards\r\nDorothea, was inwardly wrapping her soul in cold reserve. Had Mrs.\r\nCasaubon come to say anything to her about Will? If so, it was a\r\nliberty that Rosamond resented; and she prepared herself to meet every\r\nword with polite impassibility. Will had bruised her pride too sorely\r\nfor her to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea: her own\r\ninjury seemed much the greater. Dorothea was not only the “preferred”\r\nwoman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate’s\r\nbenefactor; and to poor Rosamond’s pained confused vision it seemed\r\nthat this Mrs. Casaubon—this woman who predominated in all things\r\nconcerning her—must have come now with the sense of having the\r\nadvantage, and with animosity prompting her to use it. Indeed, not\r\nRosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case,\r\nand not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have\r\nwondered why she came.\r\n\r\nLooking like the lovely ghost of herself, her graceful slimness wrapped\r\nin her soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek\r\ninevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three\r\nyards’ distance from her visitor and bowed. But Dorothea, who had taken\r\noff her gloves, from an impulse which she could never resist when she\r\nwanted a sense of freedom, came forward, and with her face full of a\r\nsad yet sweet openness, put out her hand. Rosamond could not avoid\r\nmeeting her glance, could not avoid putting her small hand into\r\nDorothea’s, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately\r\na doubt of her own prepossessions began to stir within her. Rosamond’s\r\neye was quick for faces; she saw that Mrs. Casaubon’s face looked pale\r\nand changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of\r\nher hand. But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own\r\nstrength: the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning\r\nwere the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as\r\ndangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in\r\nlooking at Rosamond, she suddenly found her heart swelling, and was\r\nunable to speak—all her effort was required to keep back tears. She\r\nsucceeded in that, and the emotion only passed over her face like the\r\nspirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond’s impression that Mrs.\r\nCasaubon’s state of mind must be something quite different from what\r\nshe had imagined.\r\n\r\nSo they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that\r\nhappened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though\r\nRosamond’s notion when she first bowed was that she should stay a long\r\nway off from Mrs. Casaubon. But she ceased thinking how anything would\r\nturn out—merely wondering what would come. And Dorothea began to speak\r\nquite simply, gathering firmness as she went on.\r\n\r\n“I had an errand yesterday which I did not finish; that is why I am\r\nhere again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell\r\nyou that I came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown\r\ntowards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you—will it not?—to know a great\r\ndeal about him, that he may not like to speak about himself just\r\nbecause it is in his own vindication and to his own honor. You will\r\nlike to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off\r\nbelieving in his high character? You will let me speak of this without\r\nthinking that I take a liberty?”\r\n\r\nThe cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous\r\nheedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond’s mind as\r\ngrounds of obstruction and hatred between her and this woman, came as\r\nsoothingly as a warm stream over her shrinking fears. Of course Mrs.\r\nCasaubon had the facts in her mind, but she was not going to speak of\r\nanything connected with them. That relief was too great for Rosamond to\r\nfeel much else at the moment. She answered prettily, in the new ease of\r\nher soul—\r\n\r\n“I know you have been very good. I shall like to hear anything you will\r\nsay to me about Tertius.”\r\n\r\n“The day before yesterday,” said Dorothea, “when I had asked him to\r\ncome to Lowick to give me his opinion on the affairs of the Hospital,\r\nhe told me everything about his conduct and feelings in this sad event\r\nwhich has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him. The reason he\r\ntold me was because I was very bold and asked him. I believed that he\r\nhad never acted dishonorably, and I begged him to tell me the history.\r\nHe confessed to me that he had never told it before, not even to you,\r\nbecause he had a great dislike to say, ‘I was not wrong,’ as if that\r\nwere proof, when there are guilty people who will say so. The truth is,\r\nhe knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets\r\nabout him; and he thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him the money\r\nbecause he repented, out of kindness, of having refused it before. All\r\nhis anxiety about his patient was to treat him rightly, and he was a\r\nlittle uncomfortable that the case did not end as he had expected; but\r\nhe thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in\r\nit on any one’s part. And I have told Mr. Farebrother, and Mr. Brooke,\r\nand Sir James Chettam: they all believe in your husband. That will\r\ncheer you, will it not? That will give you courage?”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s face had become animated, and as it beamed on Rosamond very\r\nclose to her, she felt something like bashful timidity before a\r\nsuperior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor. She said, with\r\nblushing embarrassment, “Thank you: you are very kind.”\r\n\r\n“And he felt that he had been so wrong not to pour out everything about\r\nthis to you. But you will forgive him. It was because he feels so much\r\nmore about your happiness than anything else—he feels his life bound\r\ninto one with yours, and it hurts him more than anything, that his\r\nmisfortunes must hurt you. He could speak to me because I am an\r\nindifferent person. And then I asked him if I might come to see you;\r\nbecause I felt so much for his trouble and yours. That is why I came\r\nyesterday, and why I am come to-day. Trouble is so hard to bear, is it\r\nnot?— How can we live and think that any one has trouble—piercing\r\ntrouble—and we could help them, and never try?”\r\n\r\nDorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that she was uttering,\r\nforgot everything but that she was speaking from out the heart of her\r\nown trial to Rosamond’s. The emotion had wrought itself more and more\r\ninto her utterance, till the tones might have gone to one’s very\r\nmarrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.\r\nAnd she had unconsciously laid her hand again on the little hand that\r\nshe had pressed before.\r\n\r\nRosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within her had been\r\nprobed, burst into hysterical crying as she had done the day before\r\nwhen she clung to her husband. Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave\r\nof her own sorrow returning over her—her thought being drawn to the\r\npossible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond’s mental\r\ntumult. She was beginning to fear that she should not be able to\r\nsuppress herself enough to the end of this meeting, and while her hand\r\nwas still resting on Rosamond’s lap, though the hand underneath it was\r\nwithdrawn, she was struggling against her own rising sobs. She tried to\r\nmaster herself with the thought that this might be a turning-point in\r\nthree lives—not in her own; no, there the irrevocable had happened,\r\nbut—in those three lives which were touching hers with the solemn\r\nneighborhood of danger and distress. The fragile creature who was\r\ncrying close to her—there might still be time to rescue her from the\r\nmisery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any\r\nother: she and Rosamond could never be together again with the same\r\nthrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both. She felt the\r\nrelation between them to be peculiar enough to give her a peculiar\r\ninfluence, though she had no conception that the way in which her own\r\nfeelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate.\r\n\r\nIt was a newer crisis in Rosamond’s experience than even Dorothea could\r\nimagine: she was under the first great shock that had shattered her\r\ndream-world in which she had been easily confident of herself and\r\ncritical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of\r\nfeeling in a woman whom she had approached with a shrinking aversion\r\nand dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards\r\nher, made her soul totter all the more with a sense that she had been\r\nwalking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosamond’s convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and she\r\nwithdrew the handkerchief with which she had been hiding her face, her\r\neyes met Dorothea’s as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers.\r\nWhat was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying? And\r\nDorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a\r\nsilent tear. Pride was broken down between these two.\r\n\r\n“We were talking about your husband,” Dorothea said, with some\r\ntimidity. “I thought his looks were sadly changed with suffering the\r\nother day. I had not seen him for many weeks before. He said he had\r\nbeen feeling very lonely in his trial; but I think he would have borne\r\nit all better if he had been able to be quite open with you.”\r\n\r\n“Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything,” said Rosamond,\r\nimagining that he had been complaining of her to Dorothea. “He ought\r\nnot to wonder that I object to speak to him on painful subjects.”\r\n\r\n“It was himself he blamed for not speaking,” said Dorothea. “What he\r\nsaid of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which\r\nmade you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must\r\naffect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my\r\nproposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that\r\nwould bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do\r\nanything which would be painful to you. He could say that to me,\r\nbecause he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my\r\nhusband’s illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he\r\nknows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting\r\nanother who is tied to us.”\r\n\r\nDorothea waited a little; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing\r\nover Rosamond’s face. But there was no answer, and she went on, with a\r\ngathering tremor, “Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is\r\nsomething even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some\r\none else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no\r\nuse”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her\r\nlanguage brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving\r\nor getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very\r\ndear—but it murders our marriage—and then the marriage stays with us\r\nlike a murder—and everything else is gone. And then our husband—if he\r\nloved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in\r\nhis life—”\r\n\r\nHer voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her of presuming\r\ntoo far, and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing\r\nerror. She was too much preoccupied with her own anxiety, to be aware\r\nthat Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express\r\npitying fellowship rather than rebuke, she put her hands on Rosamond’s,\r\nand said with more agitated rapidity,—“I know, I know that the feeling\r\nmay be very dear—it has taken hold of us unawares—it is so hard, it may\r\nseem like death to part with it—and we are weak—I am weak—”\r\n\r\nThe waves of her own sorrow, from out of which she was struggling to\r\nsave another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force. She stopped\r\nin speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if she were being\r\ninwardly grappled. Her face had become of a deathlier paleness, her\r\nlips trembled, and she pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that\r\nlay under them.\r\n\r\nRosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried\r\nalong in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful,\r\nundefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her\r\nlips to Dorothea’s forehead which was very near her, and then for a\r\nminute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a\r\nshipwreck.\r\n\r\n“You are thinking what is not true,” said Rosamond, in an eager\r\nhalf-whisper, while she was still feeling Dorothea’s arms round\r\nher—urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something that\r\noppressed her as if it were blood guiltiness.\r\n\r\nThey moved apart, looking at each other.\r\n\r\n“When you came in yesterday—it was not as you thought,” said Rosamond\r\nin the same tone.\r\n\r\nThere was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea. She expected a\r\nvindication of Rosamond herself.\r\n\r\n“He was telling me how he loved another woman, that I might know he\r\ncould never love me,” said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as\r\nshe went on. “And now I think he hates me because—because you mistook\r\nhim yesterday. He says it is through me that you will think ill of\r\nhim—think that he is a false person. But it shall not be through me. He\r\nhas never had any love for me—I know he has not—he has always thought\r\nslightly of me. He said yesterday that no other woman existed for him\r\nbeside you. The blame of what happened is entirely mine. He said he\r\ncould never explain to you—because of me. He said you could never think\r\nwell of him again. But now I have told you, and he cannot reproach me\r\nany more.”\r\n\r\nRosamond had delivered her soul under impulses which she had not known\r\nbefore. She had begun her confession under the subduing influence of\r\nDorothea’s emotion; and as she went on she had gathered the sense that\r\nshe was repelling Will’s reproaches, which were still like a\r\nknife-wound within her.\r\n\r\nThe revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy.\r\nIt was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning\r\nmade a resistant pain:—she could only perceive that this would be joy\r\nwhen she had recovered her power of feeling it. Her immediate\r\nconsciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she cared for\r\nRosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her last\r\nwords—\r\n\r\n“No, he cannot reproach you any more.”\r\n\r\nWith her usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she felt a\r\ngreat outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort\r\nwhich had redeemed her from suffering, not counting that the effort was\r\na reflex of her own energy. After they had been silent a little, she\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“You are not sorry that I came this morning?”\r\n\r\n“No, you have been very good to me,” said Rosamond. “I did not think\r\nthat you would be so good. I was very unhappy. I am not happy now.\r\nEverything is so sad.”\r\n\r\n“But better days will come. Your husband will be rightly valued. And he\r\ndepends on you for comfort. He loves you best. The worst loss would be\r\nto lose that—and you have not lost it,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\nShe tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own\r\nrelief, lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond’s affection\r\nwas yearning back towards her husband.\r\n\r\n“Tertius did not find fault with me, then?” said Rosamond,\r\nunderstanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs.\r\nCasaubon, and that she certainly was different from other women.\r\nPerhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question. A smile\r\nbegan to play over Dorothea’s face as she said—\r\n\r\n“No, indeed! How could you imagine it?” But here the door opened, and\r\nLydgate entered.\r\n\r\n“I am come back in my quality of doctor,” he said. “After I went away,\r\nI was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need\r\nof care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in\r\nleaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman’s I came home\r\nagain. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has\r\nchanged—I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your\r\ncarriage to come for you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! I am strong: I need the walk,” said Dorothea, rising with\r\nanimation in her face. “Mrs. Lydgate and I have chatted a great deal,\r\nand it is time for me to go. I have always been accused of being\r\nimmoderate and saying too much.”\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet\r\ngood-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between\r\nthem too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it\r\nsuperficially.\r\n\r\nAs Lydgate took her to the door she said nothing of Rosamond, but told\r\nhim of Mr. Farebrother and the other friends who had listened with\r\nbelief to his story.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back to Rosamond, she had already thrown herself on the\r\nsofa, in resigned fatigue.\r\n\r\n“Well, Rosy,” he said, standing over her, and touching her hair, “what\r\ndo you think of Mrs. Casaubon now you have seen so much of her?”\r\n\r\n“I think she must be better than any one,” said Rosamond, “and she is\r\nvery beautiful. If you go to talk to her so often, you will be more\r\ndiscontented with me than ever!”\r\n\r\nLydgate laughed at the “so often.” “But has she made you any less\r\ndiscontented with me?”\r\n\r\n“I think she has,” said Rosamond, looking up in his face. “How heavy\r\nyour eyes are, Tertius—and do push your hair back.” He lifted up his\r\nlarge white hand to obey her, and felt thankful for this little mark of\r\ninterest in him. Poor Rosamond’s vagrant fancy had come back terribly\r\nscourged—meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter. And the\r\nshelter was still there: Lydgate had accepted his narrowed lot with sad\r\nresignation. He had chosen this fragile creature, and had taken the\r\nburthen of her life upon his arms. He must walk as he could, carrying\r\nthat burthen pitifully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\n“My grief lies onward and my joy behind.”\r\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay in\r\nbanishment unless they are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled himself\r\nfrom Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his return than\r\nhis own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a\r\nstate of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind,\r\nand to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite\r\nfacility. As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult\r\nto him to say why he should not run down to Middlemarch—merely for the\r\nsake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit\r\nhe should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her, there\r\nwas no reason for him to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey\r\nwhich he had beforehand supposed that he should not take. Since he was\r\nhopelessly divided from her, he might surely venture into her\r\nneighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch\r\nover her—their opinions seemed less and less important with time and\r\nchange of air.\r\n\r\nAnd there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which\r\nseemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.\r\nWill had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a\r\nnew plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out\r\na good design had set him on debating with himself whether it would not\r\nbe a laudable use to make of his claim on Bulstrode, to urge the\r\napplication of that money which had been offered to himself as a means\r\nof carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial. The question\r\nseemed a very dubious one to Will, and his repugnance to again entering\r\ninto any relation with the banker might have made him dismiss it\r\nquickly, if there had not arisen in his imagination the probability\r\nthat his judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to\r\nMiddlemarch.\r\n\r\nThat was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming\r\ndown. He had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money\r\nquestion with him, and he had meant to amuse himself for the few\r\nevenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with\r\nfair Rosamond, without neglecting his friends at Lowick Parsonage:—if\r\nthe Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of his. He had\r\nneglected the Farebrothers before his departure, from a proud\r\nresistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews\r\nwith Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for\r\nthe vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice. Nothing\r\nhad done instead—not the opera, or the converse of zealous politicians,\r\nor the flattering reception (in dim corners) of his new hand in leading\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything\r\nwould be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there\r\nwould be no surprises in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world\r\nin a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had\r\nturned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most\r\nfatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the\r\nnightmare of consequences—he dreaded so much the immediate issues\r\nbefore him—that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the\r\nRiverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that\r\nhe might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing\r\nor saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those\r\ntangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine,\r\nfrom the shallow absoluteness of men’s judgments. He had found Lydgate,\r\nfor whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which\r\nclaimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why,\r\nin spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have\r\navoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was\r\nprecisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a\r\ncreature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral region\r\nof indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him\r\ninto the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond\r\nhad made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty\r\nwhich his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for\r\nhim. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness\r\nof his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be\r\nput to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded.\r\nAnd all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life\r\nbefore him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his\r\nfresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should\r\nnot get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note\r\nto Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But\r\nthere were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure:\r\nthe blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of\r\nthat chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged\r\nnecessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign\r\nhimself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nThus he did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach. He\r\ncame back again by it while it was still daylight, having made up his\r\nmind that he must go to Lydgate’s that evening. The Rubicon, we know,\r\nwas a very insignificant stream to look at; its significance lay\r\nentirely in certain invisible conditions. Will felt as if he were\r\nforced to cross his small boundary ditch, and what he saw beyond it was\r\nnot empire, but discontented subjection.\r\n\r\nBut it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to witness\r\nthe saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue\r\nthat may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If Dorothea, after\r\nher night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond—why, she\r\nperhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for\r\ndiscretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those\r\nthree who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s house at half-past seven that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nRosamond had been prepared for Will’s visit, and she received him with\r\na languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her nervous\r\nexhaustion, of which he could not suppose that it had any relation to\r\nWill. And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he\r\ninnocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean\r\nbackward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the\r\npart of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to\r\nRosamond, while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that\r\nscene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both,\r\nlike the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing\r\ncalled Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea,\r\nand Will came near to fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper\r\nin his saucer. He saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to\r\nhis inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had\r\nwritten to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the\r\nevening. Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle. There were\r\nonly these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—\r\n\r\n“I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about you. I\r\ntold her because she came to see me and was very kind. You will have\r\nnothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on\r\nthem with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at\r\nthe thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the\r\nuncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in\r\nhaving an explanation of his conduct offered to her. There might still\r\nremain in her mind a changed association with him which made an\r\nirremediable difference—a lasting flaw. With active fancy he wrought\r\nhimself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who\r\nhas escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the\r\ndarkness. Until that wretched yesterday—except the moment of vexation\r\nlong ago in the very same room and in the very same presence—all their\r\nvision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart,\r\nwhere the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and\r\nno other soul entered. But now—would Dorothea meet him in that world\r\nagain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n“And now good-morrow to our waking souls\r\nWhich watch not one another out of fear;\r\nFor love all love of other sights controls,\r\nAnd makes one little room, an everywhere.”\r\n—DR. DONNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the second morning after Dorothea’s visit to Rosamond, she had had\r\ntwo nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue,\r\nbut felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to\r\nsay, more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any\r\noccupation. The day before, she had taken long walks outside the\r\ngrounds, and had paid two visits to the Parsonage; but she never in her\r\nlife told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless\r\nmanner, and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her\r\nchildish restlessness. To-day was to be spent quite differently. What\r\nwas there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was\r\nwell and had flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday\r\nmorning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,\r\nand when it was useless to go into the school. But there were various\r\nsubjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved\r\nto throw herself energetically into the gravest of all. She sat down in\r\nthe library before her particular little heap of books on political\r\neconomy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light\r\nas to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s\r\nneighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most\r\ngood. Here was a weighty subject which, if she could but lay hold of\r\nit, would certainly keep her mind steady. Unhappily her mind slipped\r\noff it for a whole hour; and at the end she found herself reading\r\nsentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but\r\nnot of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should\r\nshe order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or\r\nother she preferred staying at Lowick. But her vagrant mind must be\r\nreduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked\r\nround and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre\r\nshe could arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the\r\nbest means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the\r\ngeography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often been rebuked\r\nby Mr. Casaubon? She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one: this\r\nmorning she might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was not on\r\nthe Levantine coast, and fix her total darkness about the Chalybes\r\nfirmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a fine thing to study\r\nwhen you were disposed to think of something else, being made up of\r\nnames that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them. Dorothea\r\nset earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the names\r\nin an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime. She looked\r\namusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and\r\nmarking the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip,\r\nand now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face\r\nand say, “Oh dear! oh dear!”\r\n\r\nThere was no reason why this should end any more than a merry-go-round;\r\nbut it was at last interrupted by the opening of the door and the\r\nannouncement of Miss Noble.\r\n\r\nThe little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea’s shoulder,\r\nwas warmly welcomed, but while her hand was being pressed she made many\r\nof her beaver-like noises, as if she had something difficult to say.\r\n\r\n“Do sit down,” said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward. “Am I wanted for\r\nanything? I shall be so glad if I can do anything.”\r\n\r\n“I will not stay,” said Miss Noble, putting her hand into her small\r\nbasket, and holding some article inside it nervously; “I have left a\r\nfriend in the churchyard.” She lapsed into her inarticulate sounds, and\r\nunconsciously drew forth the article which she was fingering. It was\r\nthe tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt the color mounting to\r\nher cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ladislaw,” continued the timid little woman. “He fears he has\r\noffended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him for a few\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nDorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her mind that\r\nshe could not receive him in this library, where her husband’s\r\nprohibition seemed to dwell. She looked towards the window. Could she\r\ngo out and meet him in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the trees\r\nhad begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she shrank from\r\ngoing out to him.\r\n\r\n“Do see him, Mrs. Casaubon,” said Miss Noble, pathetically; “else I\r\nmust go back and say No, and that will hurt him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will see him,” said Dorothea. “Pray tell him to come.”\r\n\r\nWhat else was there to be done? There was nothing that she longed for\r\nat that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him had\r\nthrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet\r\nshe had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her—a sense that she\r\nwas doing something daringly defiant for his sake.\r\n\r\nWhen the little lady had trotted away on her mission, Dorothea stood in\r\nthe middle of the library with her hands falling clasped before her,\r\nmaking no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified\r\nunconsciousness. What she was least conscious of just then was her own\r\nbody: she was thinking of what was likely to be in Will’s mind, and of\r\nthe hard feelings that others had had about him. How could any duty\r\nbind her to hardness? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with\r\nher feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her\r\nheart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever. “If I\r\nlove him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a\r\nvoice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library,\r\nwhen the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.\r\n\r\nShe did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity\r\nin his face than she had ever seen before. He was in a state of\r\nuncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should\r\ncondemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of her\r\n_own_ emotion. She looked as if there were a spell upon her, keeping\r\nher motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands, while some\r\nintense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes. Seeing that she\r\ndid not put out her hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said\r\nwith embarrassment, “I am so grateful to you for seeing me.”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at command.\r\nIt did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful\r\ninterpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but he went on to\r\nsay what he had made up his mind to say.\r\n\r\n“I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon.\r\nI have been punished for my impatience. You know—every one knows now—a\r\npainful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I went away, and\r\nI always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met again.”\r\n\r\nThere was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her hands,\r\nbut immediately folded them over each other.\r\n\r\n“But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. “I wished you\r\nto know that something connected with it—something which happened\r\nbefore I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At least I\r\nthought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to\r\napply some money to a public purpose—some money which he had thought of\r\ngiving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s credit that he privately\r\noffered me compensation for an old injury: he offered to give me a good\r\nincome to make amends; but I suppose you know the disagreeable story?”\r\n\r\nWill looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his manner was gathering some\r\nof the defiant courage with which he always thought of this fact in his\r\ndestiny. He added, “You know that it must be altogether painful to me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily.\r\n\r\n“I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure\r\nthat you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will. Why should\r\nhe mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She knew that he had\r\navowed his love for her. “I felt that”—he broke off, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n“You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea, her\r\nface brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its\r\nbeautiful stem.\r\n\r\n“I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth\r\ncreate a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in\r\nothers,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old way, and\r\nlooking with a grave appeal into her eyes.\r\n\r\n“If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to\r\nyou,” said Dorothea, fervidly. “Nothing could have changed me but—” her\r\nheart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great\r\neffort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that\r\nyou were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,”\r\nsaid Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers. “I\r\nmean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t\r\ncare about anything that was left. I thought it was all over with me,\r\nand there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a\r\nvague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob.\r\nBut he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have\r\ndone for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was difficult to loose\r\nthe hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed\r\nher, looked and moved away.\r\n\r\n“See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,”\r\nshe said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only\r\na dim sense of what she was doing.\r\n\r\nWill followed her at a little distance, and leaned against the tall\r\nback of a leather chair, on which he ventured now to lay his hat and\r\ngloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to\r\nwhich he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea’s presence.\r\nIt must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on\r\nthe chair. He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now.\r\n\r\nThey stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the\r\nevergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside\r\nof their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the\r\nprospect of a storm so much: it delivered him from the necessity of\r\ngoing away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the\r\nthunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but\r\nthere came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each\r\nother, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking\r\nof.\r\n\r\n“That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing\r\nto try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people’s good\r\nwould remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed\r\nto see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can\r\nhardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that feeling had\r\nnot come to me to make strength.”\r\n\r\n“You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,” said Will; “the misery\r\nof knowing that you must despise me.”\r\n\r\n“But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had begun\r\nimpetuously, but broke off.\r\n\r\nWill colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in\r\nthe vision of a fatality that kept them apart. He was silent a moment,\r\nand then said passionately—\r\n\r\n“We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without\r\ndisguise. Since I must go away—since we must always be divided—you may\r\nthink of me as one on the brink of the grave.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit\r\neach of them up for the other—and the light seemed to be the terror of\r\na hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will\r\nfollowed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they\r\nstood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the\r\nstorm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,\r\nand the rain began to pour down. Then they turned their faces towards\r\neach other, with the memory of his last words in them, and they did not\r\nloose each other’s hands.\r\n\r\n“There is no hope for me,” said Will. “Even if you loved me as well as\r\nI love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most likely always\r\nbe very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing but a\r\ncreeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to belong to each other. It\r\nis perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you. I meant to go\r\naway into silence, but I have not been able to do what I meant.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be sorry,” said Dorothea, in her clear tender tones. “I would\r\nrather share all the trouble of our parting.”\r\n\r\nHer lips trembled, and so did his. It was never known which lips were\r\nthe first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly,\r\nand then they moved apart.\r\n\r\nThe rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit\r\nwere within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was\r\none of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a\r\ncertain awe.\r\n\r\nDorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the\r\nmiddle of the room, and with her hands folded over each other on her\r\nlap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant\r\nlooking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on\r\nhers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat in that way\r\nwithout looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall\r\nin stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them\r\ncould begin to utter.\r\n\r\nBut when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will. With\r\npassionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were threatening him,\r\nhe started up and said, “It is impossible!”\r\n\r\nHe went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be\r\nbattling with his own anger, while she looked towards him sadly.\r\n\r\n“It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,”\r\nhe burst out again; “it is more intolerable—to have our life maimed by\r\npetty accidents.”\r\n\r\n“No—don’t say that—your life need not be maimed,” said Dorothea,\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak in\r\nthat way—as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery of\r\nit, but I don’t. It is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if\r\nit were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact. We can\r\nnever be married.”\r\n\r\n“Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n“When?” said Will, bitterly. “What is the use of counting on any\r\nsuccess of mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more than\r\nkeep myself decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere pen and\r\na mouthpiece. I can see that clearly enough. I could not offer myself\r\nto any woman, even if she had no luxuries to renounce.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she\r\nwanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult. She was wholly\r\npossessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within her. And it\r\nwas very hard that she could not say what she wanted to say. Will was\r\nlooking out of the window angrily. If he would have looked at her and\r\nnot gone away from her side, she thought everything would have been\r\neasier. At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and\r\nstretching his hand automatically towards his hat, said with a sort of\r\nexasperation, “Good-by.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I cannot bear it—my heart will break,” said Dorothea, starting\r\nfrom her seat, the flood of her young passion bearing down all the\r\nobstructions which had kept her silent—the great tears rising and\r\nfalling in an instant: “I don’t mind about poverty—I hate my wealth.”\r\n\r\nIn an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her, but she\r\ndrew her head back and held his away gently that she might go on\r\nspeaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very simply, while\r\nshe said in a sobbing childlike way, “We could live quite well on my\r\nown fortune—it is too much—seven hundred a-year—I want so little—no new\r\nclothes—and I will learn what everything costs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n“Though it be songe of old and yonge,\r\n    That I sholde be to blame,\r\nTheyrs be the charge, that spoke so large\r\n    In hurtynge of my name.”\r\n—_The Not-Browne Mayde_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that\r\nexplains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the\r\nlawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the “Times”\r\nin his hands behind him, while he talked with a trout-fisher’s\r\ndispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James\r\nChettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam, and Celia were\r\nsometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking to meet little\r\nArthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as became the\r\ninfantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome\r\nsilken fringe.\r\n\r\nThe ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs. Cadwallader\r\nwas strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain\r\nfrom her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely\r\nat the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air\r\nfrom the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign\r\nher soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married\r\na baronet. Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very\r\nreprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry’s mother was a Miss\r\nWalsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be “Lady” than\r\n“Mrs.,” and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she could have\r\nher own way. Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to\r\ntake precedence when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop\r\nof good blood in your veins; and Celia again, stopping to look at\r\nArthur, said, “It would be very nice, though, if he were a Viscount—and\r\nhis lordship’s little tooth coming through! He might have been, if\r\nJames had been an Earl.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Celia,” said the Dowager, “James’s title is worth far more\r\nthan any new earldom. I never wished his father to be anything else\r\nthan Sir James.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I only meant about Arthur’s little tooth,” said Celia,\r\ncomfortably. “But see, here is my uncle coming.”\r\n\r\nShe tripped off to meet her uncle, while Sir James and Mr. Cadwallader\r\ncame forward to make one group with the ladies. Celia had slipped her\r\narm through her uncle’s, and he patted her hand with a rather\r\nmelancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it was evident that Mr.\r\nBrooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by the\r\nstate of politics; and as he was shaking hands all round without more\r\ngreeting than a “Well, you’re all here, you know,” the Rector said,\r\nlaughingly—\r\n\r\n“Don’t take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart, Brooke;\r\nyou’ve got all the riff-raff of the country on your side.”\r\n\r\n“The Bill, eh? ah!” said Mr. Brooke, with a mild distractedness of\r\nmanner. “Thrown out, you know, eh? The Lords are going too far, though.\r\nThey’ll have to pull up. Sad news, you know. I mean, here at home—sad\r\nnews. But you must not blame me, Chettam.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said Sir James. “Not another gamekeeper shot, I\r\nhope? It’s what I should expect, when a fellow like Trapping Bass is\r\nlet off so easily.”\r\n\r\n“Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house, you\r\nknow,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding at the Cadwalladers, to show that he\r\nincluded them in his confidence. “As to poachers like Trapping Bass,\r\nyou know, Chettam,” he continued, as they were entering, “when you are\r\na magistrate, you’ll not find it so easy to commit. Severity is all\r\nvery well, but it’s a great deal easier when you’ve got somebody to do\r\nit for you. You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you\r\nknow—you’re not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation. When he\r\nhad something painful to tell, it was usually his way to introduce it\r\namong a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that\r\nwould get a milder flavor by mixing. He continued his chat with Sir\r\nJames about the poachers until they were all seated, and Mrs.\r\nCadwallader, impatient of this drivelling, said—\r\n\r\n“I’m dying to know the sad news. The gamekeeper is not shot: that is\r\nsettled. What is it, then?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “I’m glad\r\nyou and the Rector are here; it’s a family matter—but you will help us\r\nall to bear it, Cadwallader. I’ve got to break it to you, my dear.”\r\nHere Mr. Brooke looked at Celia—“You’ve no notion what it is, you know.\r\nAnd, Chettam, it will annoy you uncommonly—but, you see, you have not\r\nbeen able to hinder it, any more than I have. There’s something\r\nsingular in things: they come round, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think of her\r\nsister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She had seated\r\nherself on a low stool against her husband’s knee.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a\r\nsort of will to make things worse.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily. “But _what_ is worse?”\r\n\r\n“Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\nnodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a\r\nfrightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. Sir James was almost\r\nwhite with anger, but he did not speak.\r\n\r\n“Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Not to _young_ Ladislaw?”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell into a\r\nprudential silence.\r\n\r\n“You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm towards her\r\nhusband. “Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or\r\nrather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever. _You_\r\nsupposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.”\r\n\r\n“So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector, quietly.\r\n\r\n“When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear any one\r\nelse speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday,” said Mr. Brooke, meekly. “I went to Lowick. Dorothea sent\r\nfor me, you know. It had come about quite suddenly—neither of them had\r\nany idea two days ago—not any idea, you know. There’s something\r\nsingular in things. But Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use\r\nopposing. I put it strongly to her. I did my duty, Chettam. But she can\r\nact as she likes, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year\r\nago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he needed\r\nsomething strong to say.\r\n\r\n“Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said Celia.\r\n\r\n“Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,” said Mr.\r\nCadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so overmastered by\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n“That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of\r\nright—when the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James,\r\nstill in his white indignation. “It is perfectly scandalous. If\r\nLadislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country\r\nat once, and never shown his face in it again. However, I am not\r\nsurprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I said what ought to be\r\ndone. But I was not listened to.”\r\n\r\n“You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n“You wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as\r\nwe liked with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable fellow—I always\r\nsaid he was a remarkable fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity\r\nyou formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that for his\r\nbeing lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing a\r\nwoman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made\r\nlittle stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily. “A\r\nman so marked out by her husband’s will, that delicacy ought to have\r\nforbidden her from seeing him again—who takes her out of her proper\r\nrank—into poverty—has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice—has\r\nalways had an objectionable position—a bad origin—and, _I believe_, is\r\na man of little principle and light character. That is my opinion.” Sir\r\nJames ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.\r\n\r\n“I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke, apologetically—“I\r\nmean the poverty, and abandoning her position. I said, ‘My dear, you\r\ndon’t know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no\r\ncarriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don’t know\r\nwho you are.’ I put it strongly to her. But I advise you to talk to\r\nDorothea herself. The fact is, she has a dislike to Casaubon’s\r\nproperty. You will hear what she says, you know.”\r\n\r\n“No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness. “I\r\ncannot bear to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much\r\nthat a woman like Dorothea should have done what is wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to\r\nall this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be acting\r\nimprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we\r\nmen have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a\r\nwoman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a\r\nwrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits a wrong\r\naction in marrying Ladislaw.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it\r\nis unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take\r\nlife easily, he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to\r\nthose who felt themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out\r\nhis handkerchief and began to bite the corner.\r\n\r\n“It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,” said Celia, wishing to justify\r\nher husband. “She said she _never would_ marry again—not anybody at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam,\r\nmajestically, as if this were royal evidence.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader. “The only wonder to me is, that any of you are surprised.\r\nYou did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down\r\nhere to woo her with his philanthropy, he might have carried her off\r\nbefore the year was over. There was no safety in anything else. Mr.\r\nCasaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible. He made\r\nhimself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make him so—and then he dared\r\nher to contradict him. It’s the way to make any trumpery tempting, to\r\nticket it at a high price in that way.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,” said Sir James,\r\nstill feeling a little stung, and turning round in his chair towards\r\nthe Rector. “He’s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I\r\nmust speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off\r\nMr. Brooke. “I suppose others will find his society too pleasant to\r\ncare about the propriety of the thing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his\r\nleg, “I can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her up to\r\na certain point. I said, ‘My dear, I won’t refuse to give you away.’ I\r\nhad spoken strongly before. But I can cut off the entail, you know. It\r\nwill cost money and be troublesome; but I can do it, you know.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he was both showing his\r\nown force of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet’s\r\nvexation. He had hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he was\r\naware of. He had touched a motive of which Sir James was ashamed. The\r\nmass of his feeling about Dorothea’s marriage to Ladislaw was due\r\npartly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable opinion, partly to a\r\njealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw’s case than in Casaubon’s.\r\nHe was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea. But\r\namid that mass ran a vein of which he was too good and honorable a man\r\nto like the avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of\r\nthe two estates—Tipton and Freshitt—lying charmingly within a\r\nring-fence, was a prospect that flattered him for his son and heir.\r\nHence when Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt\r\na sudden embarrassment; there was a stoppage in his throat; he even\r\nblushed. He had found more words than usual in the first jet of his\r\nanger, but Mr. Brooke’s propitiation was more clogging to his tongue\r\nthan Mr. Cadwallader’s caustic hint.\r\n\r\nBut Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s suggestion\r\nof the marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as little eagerness\r\nof manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, “Do\r\nyou mean that Dodo is going to be married directly, uncle?”\r\n\r\n“In three weeks, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, helplessly. “I can do\r\nnothing to hinder it, Cadwallader,” he added, turning for a little\r\ncountenance toward the Rector, who said—\r\n\r\n“_I_ should not make any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor, that\r\nis her affair. Nobody would have said anything if she had married the\r\nyoung fellow because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer\r\nthan they will be. Here is Elinor,” continued the provoking husband;\r\n“she vexed her friends by me: I had hardly a thousand a-year—I was a\r\nlout—nobody could see anything in me—my shoes were not the right\r\ncut—all the men wondered how a woman could like me. Upon my word, I\r\nmust take Ladislaw’s part until I hear more harm of him.”\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,” said his wife.\r\n“Everything is all one—that is the beginning and end with you. As if\r\nyou had not been a Cadwallader! Does any one suppose that I would have\r\ntaken such a monster as you by any other name?”\r\n\r\n“And a clergyman too,” observed Lady Chettam with approbation. “Elinor\r\ncannot be said to have descended below her rank. It is difficult to say\r\nwhat Mr. Ladislaw is, eh, James?”\r\n\r\nSir James gave a small grunt, which was less respectful than his usual\r\nmode of answering his mother. Celia looked up at him like a thoughtful\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n“It must be admitted that his blood is a frightful mixture!” said Mrs.\r\nCadwallader. “The Casaubon cuttle-fish fluid to begin with, and then a\r\nrebellious Polish fiddler or dancing-master, was it?—and then an old\r\nclo—”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Elinor,” said the Rector, rising. “It is time for us to go.”\r\n\r\n“After all, he is a pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, rising too,\r\nand wishing to make amends. “He is like the fine old Crichley portraits\r\nbefore the idiots came in.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Brooke, starting up with alacrity. “You\r\nmust all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know—eh, Celia, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“You will, James—won’t you?” said Celia, taking her husband’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course, if you like,” said Sir James, pulling down his\r\nwaistcoat, but unable yet to adjust his face good-humoredly. “That is\r\nto say, if it is not to meet anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no,” said Mr. Brooke, understanding the condition. “Dorothea\r\nwould not come, you know, unless you had been to see her.”\r\n\r\nWhen Sir James and Celia were alone, she said, “Do you mind about my\r\nhaving the carriage to go to Lowick, James?”\r\n\r\n“What, now, directly?” he answered, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is very important,” said Celia.\r\n\r\n“Remember, Celia, I cannot see her,” said Sir James.\r\n\r\n“Not if she gave up marrying?”\r\n\r\n“What is the use of saying that?—however, I’m going to the stables.\r\nI’ll tell Briggs to bring the carriage round.”\r\n\r\nCelia thought it was of great use, if not to say that, at least to take\r\na journey to Lowick in order to influence Dorothea’s mind. All through\r\ntheir girlhood she had felt that she could act on her sister by a word\r\njudiciously placed—by opening a little window for the daylight of her\r\nown understanding to enter among the strange colored lamps by which\r\nDodo habitually saw. And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to\r\nadvise her childless sister. How could any one understand Dodo so well\r\nas Celia did or love her so tenderly?\r\n\r\nDorothea, busy in her boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of\r\nher sister so soon after the revelation of her intended marriage. She\r\nhad prefigured to herself, even with exaggeration, the disgust of her\r\nfriends, and she had even feared that Celia might be kept aloof from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“O Kitty, I am delighted to see you!” said Dorothea, putting her hands\r\non Celia’s shoulders, and beaming on her. “I almost thought you would\r\nnot come to me.”\r\n\r\n“I have not brought Arthur, because I was in a hurry,” said Celia, and\r\nthey sat down on two small chairs opposite each other, with their knees\r\ntouching.\r\n\r\n“You know, Dodo, it is very bad,” said Celia, in her placid guttural,\r\nlooking as prettily free from humors as possible. “You have\r\ndisappointed us all so. And I can’t think that it ever _will_ be—you\r\nnever can go and live in that way. And then there are all your plans!\r\nYou never can have thought of that. James would have taken any trouble\r\nfor you, and you might have gone on all your life doing what you\r\nliked.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, dear,” said Dorothea, “I never could do anything that\r\nI liked. I have never carried out any plan yet.”\r\n\r\n“Because you always wanted things that wouldn’t do. But other plans\r\nwould have come. And how _can_ you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we none of\r\nus ever thought you _could_ marry? It shocks James so dreadfully. And\r\nthen it is all so different from what you have always been. You would\r\nhave Mr. Casaubon because he had such a great soul, and was so old and\r\ndismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has\r\ngot no estate or anything. I suppose it is because you must be making\r\nyourself uncomfortable in some way or other.”\r\n\r\nDorothea laughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, it is very serious, Dodo,” said Celia, becoming more impressive.\r\n“How will you live? and you will go away among queer people. And I\r\nshall never see you—and you won’t mind about little Arthur—and I\r\nthought you always would—”\r\n\r\nCelia’s rare tears had got into her eyes, and the corners of her mouth\r\nwere agitated.\r\n\r\n“Dear Celia,” said Dorothea, with tender gravity, “if you don’t ever\r\nsee me, it will not be my fault.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it will,” said Celia, with the same touching distortion of her\r\nsmall features. “How can I come to you or have you with me when James\r\ncan’t bear it?—that is because he thinks it is not right—he thinks you\r\nare so wrong, Dodo. But you always were wrong: only I can’t help loving\r\nyou. And nobody can think where you will live: where can you go?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to London,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“How can you always live in a street? And you will be so poor. I could\r\ngive you half my things, only how can I, when I never see you?”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, Kitty,” said Dorothea, with gentle warmth. “Take comfort:\r\nperhaps James will forgive me some time.”\r\n\r\n“But it would be much better if you would not be married,” said Celia,\r\ndrying her eyes, and returning to her argument; “then there would be\r\nnothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought you\r\ncould do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at\r\nall being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been\r\nmaking, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper\r\nhusband for you. And you _said_ you would never be married again.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,” said\r\nDorothea, “and that I might have done something better, if I had been\r\nbetter. But this is what I am going to do. I have promised to marry Mr.\r\nLadislaw; and I am going to marry him.”\r\n\r\nThe tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long\r\nlearned to recognize. She was silent a few moments, and then said, as\r\nif she had dismissed all contest, “Is he very fond of you, Dodo?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. I am very fond of him.”\r\n\r\n“That is nice,” said Celia, comfortably. “Only I would rather you had\r\nsuch a sort of husband as James is, with a place very near, that I\r\ncould drive to.”\r\n\r\nDorothea smiled, and Celia looked rather meditative. Presently she\r\nsaid, “I cannot think how it all came about.” Celia thought it would be\r\npleasant to hear the story.\r\n\r\n“I dare say not,” said Dorothea, pinching her sister’s chin. “If you\r\nknew how it came about, it would not seem wonderful to you.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you tell me?” said Celia, settling her arms cozily.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\n“Then went the jury out whose names were Mr. Blindman, Mr. No-good, Mr.\r\nMalice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind, Mr.\r\nEnmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, Mr. Implacable, who\r\nevery one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves, and\r\nafterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the\r\njudge. And first among themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I\r\nsee clearly that this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away\r\nwith such a fellow from the earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the\r\nvery look of him. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him.\r\nNor I, said Mr. Live-loose; for he would be always condemning my way.\r\nHang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.\r\nMy heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr.\r\nLiar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch\r\nhim out of the way said Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might\r\nI have all the world given me, I could not be reconciled to him;\r\ntherefore let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death.”—_Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen immortal Bunyan makes his picture of the persecuting passions\r\nbringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful? That is a\r\nrare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know\r\nourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd—to be sure that what we\r\nare denounced for is solely the good in us. The pitiable lot is that of\r\nthe man who could not call himself a martyr even though he were to\r\npersuade himself that the men who stoned him were but ugly passions\r\nincarnate—who knows that he is stoned, not for professing the Right,\r\nbut for not being the man he professed to be.\r\n\r\nThis was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while he\r\nmade his preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and going to end\r\nhis stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference of new faces.\r\nThe duteous merciful constancy of his wife had delivered him from one\r\ndread, but it could not hinder her presence from being still a tribunal\r\nbefore which he shrank from confession and desired advocacy. His\r\nequivocations with himself about the death of Raffles had sustained the\r\nconception of an Omniscience whom he prayed to, yet he had a terror\r\nupon him which would not let him expose them to judgment by a full\r\nconfession to his wife: the acts which he had washed and diluted with\r\ninward argument and motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy\r\nto win invisible pardon—what name would she call them by? That she\r\nshould ever silently call his acts Murder was what he could not bear.\r\nHe felt shrouded by her doubt: he got strength to face her from the\r\nsense that she could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst\r\ncondemnation on him. Some time, perhaps—when he was dying—he would tell\r\nher all: in the deep shadow of that time, when she held his hand in the\r\ngathering darkness, she might listen without recoiling from his touch.\r\nPerhaps: but concealment had been the habit of his life, and the\r\nimpulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nHe was full of timid care for his wife, not only because he deprecated\r\nany harshness of judgment from her, but because he felt a deep distress\r\nat the sight of her suffering. She had sent her daughters away to board\r\nat a school on the coast, that this crisis might be hidden from them as\r\nfar as possible. Set free by their absence from the intolerable\r\nnecessity of accounting for her grief or of beholding their frightened\r\nwonder, she could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every\r\nday streaking her hair with whiteness and making her eyelids languid.\r\n\r\n“Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet,”\r\nBulstrode had said to her; “I mean with regard to arrangements of\r\nproperty. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this\r\nneighborhood, but to leave it to you as a safe provision. If you have\r\nany wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.”\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, when she had returned from a visit to her\r\nbrother’s, she began to speak to her husband on a subject which had for\r\nsome time been in her mind.\r\n\r\n“I _should_ like to do something for my brother’s family, Nicholas; and\r\nI think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond and her husband.\r\nWalter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and his practice is almost\r\ngood for nothing, and they have very little left to settle anywhere\r\nwith. I would rather do without something for ourselves, to make some\r\namends to my poor brother’s family.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the\r\nphrase “make some amends;” knowing that her husband must understand\r\nher. He had a particular reason, which she was not aware of, for\r\nwincing under her suggestion. He hesitated before he said—\r\n\r\n“It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose, my\r\ndear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me.\r\nHe has returned the thousand pounds which I lent him. Mrs. Casaubon\r\nadvanced him the sum for that purpose. Here is his letter.”\r\n\r\nThe letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of Mrs.\r\nCasaubon’s loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held\r\nit a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with her\r\nhusband. She was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after the\r\nother, her chin trembling as she wiped them away. Bulstrode, sitting\r\nopposite to her, ached at the sight of that grief-worn face, which two\r\nmonths before had been bright and blooming. It had aged to keep sad\r\ncompany with his own withered features. Urged into some effort at\r\ncomforting her, he said—\r\n\r\n“There is another means, Harriet, by which I might do a service to your\r\nbrother’s family, if you like to act in it. And it would, I think, be\r\nbeneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of managing the land\r\nwhich I mean to be yours.”\r\n\r\nShe looked attentive.\r\n\r\n“Garth once thought of undertaking the management of Stone Court in\r\norder to place your nephew Fred there. The stock was to remain as it\r\nis, and they were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an\r\nordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning for the young man,\r\nin conjunction with his employment under Garth. Would it be a\r\nsatisfaction to you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it would,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with some return of energy. “Poor\r\nWalter is so cast down; I would try anything in my power to do him some\r\ngood before I go away. We have always been brother and sister.”\r\n\r\n“You must make the proposal to Garth yourself, Harriet,” said Mr.\r\nBulstrode, not liking what he had to say, but desiring the end he had\r\nin view, for other reasons besides the consolation of his wife. “You\r\nmust state to him that the land is virtually yours, and that he need\r\nhave no transactions with me. Communications can be made through\r\nStandish. I mention this, because Garth gave up being my agent. I can\r\nput into your hands a paper which he himself drew up, stating\r\nconditions; and you can propose his renewed acceptance of them. I think\r\nit is not unlikely that he will accept when you propose the thing for\r\nthe sake of your nephew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\n“Le cœur se sature d’amour comme d’un sel divin qui le conserve; de là\r\nl’incorruptible adhérence de ceux qui se sont aimés dès l’aube de la\r\nvie, et la fraîcheur des vielles amours prolongées. Il existe un\r\nembaumement d’amour. C’est de Daphnis et Chloé que sont faits Philémon\r\net Baucis. Cette vieillesse-là, ressemblance du soir avec\r\nl’aurore.”—VICTOR HUGO: _L’homme qui rit_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Garth, hearing Caleb enter the passage about tea-time, opened the\r\nparlor-door and said, “There you are, Caleb. Have you had your dinner?”\r\n(Mr. Garth’s meals were much subordinated to “business.”)\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, a good dinner—cold mutton and I don’t know what. Where is\r\nMary?”\r\n\r\n“In the garden with Letty, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Fred is not come yet?”\r\n\r\n“No. Are you going out again without taking tea, Caleb?” said Mrs.\r\nGarth, seeing that her absent-minded husband was putting on again the\r\nhat which he had just taken off.\r\n\r\n“No, no; I’m only going to Mary a minute.”\r\n\r\nMary was in a grassy corner of the garden, where there was a swing\r\nloftily hung between two pear-trees. She had a pink kerchief tied over\r\nher head, making a little poke to shade her eyes from the level\r\nsunbeams, while she was giving a glorious swing to Letty, who laughed\r\nand screamed wildly.\r\n\r\nSeeing her father, Mary left the swing and went to meet him, pushing\r\nback the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him with the involuntary\r\nsmile of loving pleasure.\r\n\r\n“I came to look for you, Mary,” said Mr. Garth. “Let us walk about a\r\nbit.”\r\n\r\nMary knew quite well that her father had something particular to say:\r\nhis eyebrows made their pathetic angle, and there was a tender gravity\r\nin his voice: these things had been signs to her when she was Letty’s\r\nage. She put her arm within his, and they turned by the row of\r\nnut-trees.\r\n\r\n“It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary,” said her\r\nfather, not looking at her, but at the end of the stick which he held\r\nin his other hand.\r\n\r\n“Not a sad while, father—I mean to be merry,” said Mary, laughingly. “I\r\nhave been single and merry for four-and-twenty years and more: I\r\nsuppose it will not be quite as long again as that.” Then, after a\r\nlittle pause, she said, more gravely, bending her face before her\r\nfather’s, “If you are contented with Fred?”\r\n\r\nCaleb screwed up his mouth and turned his head aside wisely.\r\n\r\n“Now, father, you did praise him last Wednesday. You said he had an\r\nuncommon notion of stock, and a good eye for things.”\r\n\r\n“Did I?” said Caleb, rather slyly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I put it all down, and the date, _anno Domini_, and everything,”\r\nsaid Mary. “You like things to be neatly booked. And then his behavior\r\nto you, father, is really good; he has a deep respect for you; and it\r\nis impossible to have a better temper than Fred has.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay; you want to coax me into thinking him a fine match.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, father. I don’t love him because he is a fine match.”\r\n\r\n“What for, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, because I have always loved him. I should never like\r\nscolding any one else so well; and that is a point to be thought of in\r\na husband.”\r\n\r\n“Your mind is quite settled, then, Mary?” said Caleb, returning to his\r\nfirst tone. “There’s no other wish come into it since things have been\r\ngoing on as they have been of late?” (Caleb meant a great deal in that\r\nvague phrase;) “because, better late than never. A woman must not force\r\nher heart—she’ll do a man no good by that.”\r\n\r\n“My feelings have not changed, father,” said Mary, calmly. “I shall be\r\nconstant to Fred as long as he is constant to me. I don’t think either\r\nof us could spare the other, or like any one else better, however much\r\nwe might admire them. It would make too great a difference to us—like\r\nseeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for\r\neverything. We must wait for each other a long while; but Fred knows\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nInstead of speaking immediately, Caleb stood still and screwed his\r\nstick on the grassy walk. Then he said, with emotion in his voice,\r\n“Well, I’ve got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live\r\nat Stone Court, and managing the land there?”\r\n\r\n“How can that ever be, father?” said Mary, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“He would manage it for his aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to\r\nme begging and praying. She wants to do the lad good, and it might be a\r\nfine thing for him. With saving, he might gradually buy the stock, and\r\nhe has a turn for farming.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Fred would be so happy! It is too good to believe.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but mind you,” said Caleb, turning his head warningly, “I must\r\ntake it on _my_ shoulders, and be responsible, and see after\r\neverything; and that will grieve your mother a bit, though she mayn’t\r\nsay so. Fred had need be careful.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is too much, father,” said Mary, checked in her joy. “There\r\nwould be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay; work is my delight, child, when it doesn’t vex your mother.\r\nAnd then, if you and Fred get married,” here Caleb’s voice shook just\r\nperceptibly, “he’ll be steady and saving; and you’ve got your mother’s\r\ncleverness, and mine too, in a woman’s sort of way; and you’ll keep him\r\nin order. He’ll be coming by-and-by, so I wanted to tell you first,\r\nbecause I think you’d like to tell _him_ by yourselves. After that, I\r\ncould talk it well over with him, and we could go into business and the\r\nnature of things.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you dear good father!” cried Mary, putting her hands round her\r\nfather’s neck, while he bent his head placidly, willing to be caressed.\r\n“I wonder if any other girl thinks her father the best man in the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, child; you’ll think your husband better.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” said Mary, relapsing into her usual tone; “husbands are\r\nan inferior class of men, who require keeping in order.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were entering the house with Letty, who had run to join them,\r\nMary saw Fred at the orchard-gate, and went to meet him.\r\n\r\n“What fine clothes you wear, you extravagant youth!” said Mary, as Fred\r\nstood still and raised his hat to her with playful formality. “You are\r\nnot learning economy.”\r\n\r\n“Now that is too bad, Mary,” said Fred. “Just look at the edges of\r\nthese coat-cuffs! It is only by dint of good brushing that I look\r\nrespectable. I am saving up three suits—one for a wedding-suit.”\r\n\r\n“How very droll you will look!—like a gentleman in an old\r\nfashion-book.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, they will keep two years.”\r\n\r\n“Two years! be reasonable, Fred,” said Mary, turning to walk. “Don’t\r\nencourage flattering expectations.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we\r\ncan’t be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when\r\nit comes.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged\r\nflattering expectations, and they did him harm.”\r\n\r\n“Mary, if you’ve got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I\r\nshall go into the house to Mr. Garth. I am out of spirits. My father is\r\nso cut up—home is not like itself. I can’t bear any more bad news.”\r\n\r\n“Should you call it bad news to be told that you were to live at Stone\r\nCourt, and manage the farm, and be remarkably prudent, and save money\r\nevery year till all the stock and furniture were your own, and you were\r\na distinguished agricultural character, as Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\r\nsays—rather stout, I fear, and with the Greek and Latin sadly\r\nweather-worn?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean anything except nonsense, Mary?” said Fred, coloring\r\nslightly nevertheless.\r\n\r\n“That is what my father has just told me of as what may happen, and he\r\nnever talks nonsense,” said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while he\r\ngrasped her hand as they walked, till it rather hurt her; but she would\r\nnot complain.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I could be a tremendously good fellow then, Mary, and we could be\r\nmarried directly.”\r\n\r\n“Not so fast, sir; how do you know that I would not rather defer our\r\nmarriage for some years? That would leave you time to misbehave, and\r\nthen if I liked some one else better, I should have an excuse for\r\njilting you.”\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t joke, Mary,” said Fred, with strong feeling. “Tell me\r\nseriously that all this is true, and that you are happy because of\r\nit—because you love me best.”\r\n\r\n“It is all true, Fred, and I am happy because of it—because I love you\r\nbest,” said Mary, in a tone of obedient recitation.\r\n\r\nThey lingered on the door-step under the steep-roofed porch, and Fred\r\nalmost in a whisper said—\r\n\r\n“When we were first engaged, with the umbrella-ring, Mary, you used\r\nto—”\r\n\r\nThe spirit of joy began to laugh more decidedly in Mary’s eyes, but the\r\nfatal Ben came running to the door with Brownie yapping behind him,\r\nand, bouncing against them, said—\r\n\r\n“Fred and Mary! are you ever coming in?—or may I eat your cake?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINALE.\r\n\r\nEvery limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young\r\nlives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know\r\nwhat befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of a life,\r\nhowever typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be\r\nkept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers\r\nmay find their long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand\r\nretrieval.\r\n\r\nMarriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a\r\ngreat beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in\r\nEden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of\r\nthe wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic—the gradual\r\nconquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the\r\nadvancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nSome set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope\r\nand enthusiasm and get broken by the way, wanting patience with each\r\nother and the world.\r\n\r\nAll who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that\r\nthese two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness.\r\nFred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He became rather\r\ndistinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical\r\nfarmer, and produced a work on the “Cultivation of Green Crops and the\r\nEconomy of Cattle-Feeding” which won him high congratulations at\r\nagricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved:\r\nmost persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred’s\r\nauthorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred\r\nVincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.\r\n\r\nBut when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called “Stories of\r\nGreat Men, taken from Plutarch,” and had it printed and published by\r\nGripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the\r\ncredit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the\r\nUniversity, “where the ancients were studied,” and might have been a\r\nclergyman if he had chosen.\r\n\r\nIn this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived,\r\nand that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since\r\nit was always done by somebody else.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after his\r\nmarriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother,\r\nwho gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that he\r\nwas never again misled by his hopefulness: the yield of crops or the\r\nprofits of a cattle sale usually fell below his estimate; and he was\r\nalways prone to believe that he could make money by the purchase of a\r\nhorse which turned out badly—though this, Mary observed, was of course\r\nthe fault of the horse, not of Fred’s judgment. He kept his love of\r\nhorsemanship, but he rarely allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when\r\nhe did so, it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for\r\ncowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on\r\nthe five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nThere were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she brought forth\r\nmen-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her, she\r\nsaid, laughingly, “that would be too great a trial to your mother.”\r\nMrs. Vincy in her declining years, and in the diminished lustre of her\r\nhousekeeping, was much comforted by her perception that two at least of\r\nFred’s boys were real Vincys, and did not “feature the Garths.” But\r\nMary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much\r\nwhat her father must have been when he wore a round jacket, and showed\r\na marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones\r\nto bring down the mellow pears.\r\n\r\nBen and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in\r\ntheir teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more\r\ndesirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less\r\nthan boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed\r\nhow little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from\r\nbooks, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam\r\nand Eve alike—also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore\r\npetticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the\r\nformer, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more\r\nspooneys they!” and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys\r\nwere not better than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike\r\nnaughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and\r\nthrow with more precision to a greater distance. With this oracular\r\nsentence Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness; but Letty\r\ntook it ill, her feeling of superiority being stronger than her\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nFred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect that;\r\nbut he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and\r\nfurniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his\r\nhands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are always\r\npresent with farmers. Mary, in her matronly days, became as solid in\r\nfigure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys little formal\r\nteaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well\r\ngrounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, they were found quite\r\nforward enough when they went to school; perhaps, because they had\r\nliked nothing so well as being with their mother. When Fred was riding\r\nhome on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision beforehand of the\r\nbright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who\r\ncould not have Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. “He\r\nwas ten times worthier of you than I was,” Fred could now say to her,\r\nmagnanimously. “To be sure he was,” Mary answered; “and for that reason\r\nhe could do better without me. But you—I shudder to think what you\r\nwould have been—a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric\r\npocket-handkerchiefs!”\r\n\r\nOn inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit\r\nStone Court—that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their\r\nblossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees\r\nstand in stately row—and that on sunny days the two lovers who were\r\nfirst engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired\r\nplacidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old\r\nPeter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate.\r\n\r\nLydgate’s hair never became white. He died when he was only fifty,\r\nleaving his wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on his\r\nlife. He had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to\r\nthe season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having\r\nwritten a treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth\r\non its side. His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he\r\nalways regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he once\r\nmeant to do. His acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming\r\na wife, and nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond never\r\ncommitted a second compromising indiscretion. She simply continued to\r\nbe mild in her temper, inflexible in her judgment, disposed to admonish\r\nher husband, and able to frustrate him by stratagem. As the years went\r\non he opposed her less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that he had\r\nlearned the value of her opinion; on the other hand, she had a more\r\nthorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good income,\r\nand instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all\r\nflowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that she resembled.\r\nIn brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man. But he died\r\nprematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly\r\nand wealthy physician, who took kindly to her four children. She made a\r\nvery pretty show with her daughters, driving out in her carriage, and\r\noften spoke of her happiness as “a reward”—she did not say for what,\r\nbut probably she meant that it was a reward for her patience with\r\nTertius, whose temper never became faultless, and to the last\r\noccasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the\r\nsigns he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant;\r\nand when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant\r\nwhich had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains. Rosamond\r\nhad a placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had he chosen\r\nher? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he was always\r\npraising and placing above her. And thus the conversation ended with\r\nthe advantage on Rosamond’s side. But it would be unjust not to tell,\r\nthat she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in\r\nreligious remembrance the generosity which had come to her aid in the\r\nsharpest crisis of her life.\r\n\r\nDorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,\r\nfeeling that there was always something better which she might have\r\ndone, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never\r\nrepented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will\r\nLadislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as\r\nsorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a\r\nlove stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life\r\nwould have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion,\r\nand she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she\r\nhad not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself.\r\nWill became an ardent public man, working well in those times when\r\nreforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has\r\nbeen much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to\r\nParliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have\r\nliked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband\r\nshould be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should\r\ngive him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so\r\nsubstantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life\r\nof another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.\r\nBut no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought\r\nrather to have done—not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further\r\nthan the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will\r\nLadislaw.\r\n\r\nBut this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way\r\nin which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all\r\nconcerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding\r\nwith Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen had been\r\nremarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into\r\nan invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done\r\naway with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of\r\nthe whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence Mr.\r\nBrooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been\r\npresupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail\r\nwas still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring\r\ninvitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a\r\nstronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step\r\nas a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the\r\nBrookes.\r\n\r\nBut that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter\r\nhad come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it; and when\r\nSir James, unused to see her in tears, asked anxiously what was the\r\nmatter, she burst out in a wail such as he had never heard from her\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her. And\r\nI am sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what to do with\r\nthe baby—she will do wrong things with it. And they thought she would\r\ndie. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little Arthur, and\r\nDodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you would be less\r\nunkind, James!”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what do you\r\nwish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if\r\nyou wish it.” And Celia did wish it.\r\n\r\nIt was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the\r\ngrounds, began to chat with him in ignorance of the news, which Sir\r\nJames for some reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when\r\nthe entail was touched on in the usual way, he said, “My dear sir, it\r\nis not for me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that\r\nalone. I would let things remain as they are.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he did not at once find out how\r\nmuch he was relieved by the sense that he was not expected to do\r\nanything in particular.\r\n\r\nSuch being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir James\r\nshould consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband. Where\r\nwomen love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike. Sir\r\nJames never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir\r\nJames’s company mixed with another kind: they were on a footing of\r\nreciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and\r\nCelia were present.\r\n\r\nIt became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at\r\nleast two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came\r\ngradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with\r\nthe two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these\r\ncousins had been less dubiously mixed.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke lived to a good old age, and his estate was inherited by\r\nDorothea’s son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined,\r\nthinking that his opinions had less chance of being stifled if he\r\nremained out of doors.\r\n\r\nSir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a\r\nmistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in\r\nMiddlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine\r\ngirl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and\r\nin little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry\r\nhis cousin—young enough to have been his son, with no property, and not\r\nwell-born. Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually observed\r\nthat she could not have been “a nice woman,” else she would not have\r\nmarried either the one or the other.\r\n\r\nCertainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally\r\nbeautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse\r\nstruggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which\r\ngreat feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the\r\naspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so\r\nstrong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new\r\nTheresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual\r\nlife, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in\r\ndaring all for the sake of a brother’s burial: the medium in which\r\ntheir ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant\r\npeople with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many\r\nDorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that\r\nof the Dorothea whose story we know.\r\n\r\nHer finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were\r\nnot widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus\r\nbroke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on\r\nthe earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was\r\nincalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly\r\ndependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you\r\nand me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived\r\nfaithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MIDDLEMARCH ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n";
